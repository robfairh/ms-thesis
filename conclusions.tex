\section{Contribution}

% HTGR good characteristics
HTGRs have several desirable features that make them a good candidate for deployment in the near-term.
The reactor high-temperature enable hydrogen production.

% Moltres extension
To support the evolution of the HTGR technology, this work focused on the extension of Moltres capabilities to prismatic HTGRs.
% Neutronics
% Thermal-fluids

% Hydrogen
Additionally, this work studied different hydrogen production that can be coupled to a nuclear power plant.

\section{Future Work}

This section introduces some possible future work as a continuation of this thesis.
