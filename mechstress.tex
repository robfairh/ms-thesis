A gap can be created between two layers of the particle fue to the debonding of two adjacent layers during irradiation.
Fast neutron irradiation causes induced creep and irradiation-induced dimensional change.

The irradiation-induced dimensional change produces considerable stresses on the coating layers and the irradiation-induced creep relieves the stresses.

To add in TH:

The presence of crossflow is due to the nonuniform graphite contraction of the individual fuel blocks caused by irradiation.
