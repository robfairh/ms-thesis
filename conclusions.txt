Moltres has a limited capability to represent the burnup dependency of cross sections.
The cross sections of VHTR fuel elements vary significantly with burnup and fuel and moderator temperatures \cite{lee_status_2006}.
Thus, a more general capability to represent the cross sections as a function of burnup and temperatures needs to be implemented.
