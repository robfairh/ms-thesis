The code HEXNOD calculates three-dimensional problems for fast reactors and high converter light water reactors.
It implements a nodal mehtod for solving the multigroup neutron diffusion equation.

They demonstrated the accuracy of nodal methods by comparison with the finite difference methods and Monte Carlo calculations for a number of benchmark problems.

They conclude that the code HEXNOD is well suited for 3D routine analysis of fast reactors.

Earlier heaxagonal nodal diffusion methods that apply the transverse integration procedure are based on the nodal expansion method (NEM).
In this paper they use an approximate analytic solution for the transverse-averaged group fluxes.

Nodal methods explanation:
The transverse integration procedure is used for deriving auxiliary one-dimensional diffusion equations.
In the case of a hexagonal prismatic node, this leads to a set of coupled one-dimensional equations for three spatial directions in the radial plane plus one equation for the axial direction.
These equations are then solved simultaneously.

Previous work on the HEXPEDITE methodology has tested the approach against other spatial discretizations for the neutron diffusion equation in hexagonal and triangular geometry, such as the nodal expansion method (NEM) and finite difference method (FDM). These studies have established HEXPEDITEâ€™s superiority in terms of accuracy and runtime over NEM and FDM.

I say this: disadvantages of HEXPEDITE over FEM
A correction has to be applied to the multiplication factor.
HEXPEDITE cannnot accurately model the cylindrical periphery of the permanent reflector.


% for methods (tools):
One of the main issues with the generation of cross section in HTRs is the strong coupling between the blocks.
This strong coupling invalidates the assumption made in the lattice physics calculation (identical neighbors in an infinite domain).
In an ideal situation one would attempt to generate the cross sections from a 12th, 6th, or full core calculation that would consider all neighbor effects.

* Energy Group Study:
HTGR analyses require more energy groups than conventional LWR analysis because the spectral interactions between fuels and fuel and reflector are significant due to a much longer neutron mean free path.
In this work, the number of energy groups versus accuracy has been studied using the one-dimensional fuel-reflector problem.

Fuel block cross sections are normally generated from a single fuel block calculation with reflective boundary condition, assuming that the spectrum of the single block configuration is not much different from the actual one in the core.
The effects of energy group structure on the accuracy of homogenized nodal cross sections were examined by changing the number of energy groups from 4 to 23 groups.
Cross sections were generates with DRAGON at 300 K.

One of their conclusions is that the number of energy groups should be more than 4, and 7 or more would be sufficient for uranium fueled HTGR.
The accuracy is sensitive to the energy group boundaries.

Table 12 shows results.

-----> To read: Some of this should go into the lit review when I mention the choice of method.

In parallel to developing a suite of codes based on the conventional two-step lattice and whole-core calculation approach, it is important to envision and develop analysis tools for the future.
These tools should eliminate the approximations inherent in the multi-step approach for whole-core analysis and be of higher accuracy and also less cumbersome to use.
These attributes indicate that the future codes be based on a spatially-heterogeneous capability that eliminates the various stages used in current state-of-the-art tools.
One obvious choice of a code would be that based on the stochastic Monte Carlo approach.
The Monte Carlo techniques provide detailed solution of the neutron transport problem in space, energy, and angle and could be applied with great accuracy to the VHTR if fuel particles are modeled explicitly in the core calculation.
The utilization of the Monte Carlo codes is however currently unattractive because of the tremendous problem size and the need for a large number of neutron histories required for resolution of fuel element power distribution and small reactivity effects.
Furthermore, several important phenomena such as thermal feedback at power generating conditions, flux uncertainty propagation in the depletion calculation and fission product build up are not properly addressed
in these tools at the current time.
In contrast, the direct three-dimensional whole-core transport calculation employing deterministic solution techniques provides a possibility for resolving all these problems as long as the double heterogeneity modeling capability is properly incorporated.

The DIF3D core solves the three-dimensional multigroup diffusion or transport equations for given core configurations.
It has several solution options such as the finite difference diffusion theory method (FDM), the nodal expansion diffusion theory method based on the transverse integration procedure, and the VARIANT nodal transport method.

% for conclusions
Moltres has a limited capability to represent the burnup dependency of cross sections.
The cross sections of VHTR fuel elements vary significantly with burnup and fuel and moderator temperatures.
Thus, a more general capability to represent the cross sections as a function of burnup and temperatures needs to be implemented.

Reduction of the control rod cusping effec.

Control rod cusping effect:
Joo, 1984 % joo_resolution_1984

During the transient calculation with the control rod movements, partially rodded computation nodes (PRNs) usually appear.
The homogenization of PRNs is necessary for conventional diffusion nodal methods.
When the conservation of the reaction rates in PRNs is not considered, such homogenization induces a large error.

Various method to reduce this effect:
- Flux volume weighted homogenization
- Homogeneous flux volume weighted homogenization
- Heterogeneous flux volume weighted homogenization
This methods require to solve the whole core problem repeatedly updated cross sections.

Mesh reconstruction is used to remove such partially rodded cases and removes the control rod cusping effect.
The reconstruction should be performed at each time step.

I need to re read this.
...

This code system has different characteristics from those of the light
water reactors.
A prismatic VHTR has a large flux gradient.
Hence, a single assembly block calculation with the reflective boundary condition cannot give a reliable homogenized group constant set.
(I say this: Also that doesn't get the cross sections in the inner and outer reflectors.)

Due to the graphite, the resonance and up-scattering treatment are more important in a VHTR.
A conventional two energy group structure has limitations when it comes to handling such phenomena.

Thermal-fluid analysis:
CAPP code has a simplified thermal fluid analysis solver
Lee et al. 2011

The geometry details are simplified in the analysis.
The unit of the thermal calculation is the triangular prism as in a neutron diffusion solver.
(The fuel assembly is represented by 6 triangles)
Each triangular prism has a representative coolant channel (Fig. 2)

Once the temperature in the coolant was calculated. then a 2D model calculates the temperature in the moderator and fuel.
It is necessary to know the temperature in the reflector due to the core/reflector spectrum interference effect.

ABTRACT
Research to develop an accurate, systematic, inexpensive, and reliable procedure for resolving the control rod cusping problem for nodal methods in light water reactor calculations.
The cusping problem arises if the presence of a control rod partially inserted in a large spatial mesh node is represented by homogeneous cross sections of magnitudes proportional to the volume of control rod material present.
A plot of reactivity vs control rod position then exhibits unphysical cusps as the rod is withdrawn from node to node.
This effect causes conventional procedures to yield incorrect nodal power distribution and reactor eigenvalue.

CHAPTER 1
When using a nodal model, the cross sections are homogenized over a whole node.
The presence of control rods partially inserted in a node causes an axial heterogeneity.
The cross sections are then homogenized for the node.
If such homogenization is found by a simple volume averaging procedure, the resultant nodal power distribution and reactor multiplication factor are incorrect.

It is possible to circumvent this difficulty by requiring that there be horizontal nodal interface planes positioned at every control rod tip position.
For reactor transients during which control rods are moving and power dependent feedback effects are being accounted for, complications become more severe.
To solve the issue, the partially roded node is homogenized.
Volume weighted cross sections causes the control rod cusping problem.
Other models: flux-weighted cross sections.

Chapter 3:
A partially roded node PRN is present whenever the control rod tip locations do not match exactly the axial nodal interfaces.
