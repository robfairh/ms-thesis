Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) presented to possible designs: one for a prismatic fuel type helium gas-cooled reactor and one for a pebble bed fuel helium gas reactor.
Both with three basic requirements: a coolant outlet temperature of 1000C, passive safety, and a total power output consistent with that expected for commercial HTGRs.

The prismatic NGNP is a design directly based on the General Atomics Very High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (VHTR) submittal to the Generation IV Roadmap, which was based of their gas turbine-modular helium reactor (GT-MHR) design.

An important issue involving the performance of the fuel particles is the power peaking of the fuel rods.
The areas of biggest concern are the annular core interfaces with the inner and outer graphite reflectors, but primarily the inner reflector interface.
The possible solutions are:
(1) use of allocated B4C burnable poison rod locations in the fuel blocks
(2) graded particle packing fractions in the fuel rod Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 nearest the interface
(3) graded fuel enrichments in these same Rows 1-4
(4) replacement of specific fuel rods with burnable poisons (e.g. B 4 C)
(5) B 4 C loaded in the graphite reflector blocks in Rings 5 and 9 near the reflector/core interfaces.

What they did:
* They made parametric thermal-hydraulic design studies using POKE.
* Investigate design options that would allow 1000C outlet temperature, the highest possible overall core power, while maintaining the fuel temperature below 1250 C
* They studied the 600 MWt GT-MHR design with Tin 491 C and Tout 850 C:
	- evaluated two design modifications: reducing the bypass flow and better controlling the inlet coolant flow distribution.
* Evaluation of taller and higher power reactor cores with the POKE computer core:
	- 10 block 600 MWt, 12 block 720 MWt, and 14 block high 840 MWt
* Thermal-hydraulic model of the NGNP reactor vessel and reactor cavity developed with the RELAP5-3D/ATHENA.
	- The code and model were used to perform analyses of the transient response of the NGNP design and determine the effects of the core geometry on the peak reactor vessel and fuel temperatures.
* Sensibility calculations to determine the power that could be obtained for different core heights without exceeding a peak transient fuel temperature of 1600C.
	- 10 block 686 MWt, 12 block 786 MWt, and 14 block 889 MWt.
* Parametric analyses of the limiting temperature transient, the depressurized conduction cooldown design basis event using the TAC2D code.
	- Power and core temperature profiles from POKE
	- for 10 block, 621 MWt will limit the peak core temperature during the cooldown event to 1600 C.

Neutronic Results:
- Cool results: I could add that in my thesis.
Reactivity effects of Helium Gas insignificant

The annual fluence estimates are based on a capacity factor of 90\% and one year is assumed to be 365.25 days in length. (It is the flux * 3600*24*365.25 * 0.9).

Thermal-Hydraulic Results:
- They used POKE to perform the parametric studies.
- Analysis for a reactor configuration consisting of a number of regions. Individual columns (fuel columns) are the regions.
- For each region, POKE models an average coolant channel that is coupled to an adiabatic unit cell.
- using the coolant channel temperature as a boundary condition for convective heat transfer, 2D calculations are performed at each axial location to determine the moderator and fuel temperatures.
- gap between the fuel compact and the graphite moderator is modeled.
- conduction and radiation are assumed to occur across the gap.
- POKE calculates the flow distribution among the fuel columns nad the temperatures of the coolant, graphite, and fuel at each axial location
- POKE also calculates the axial pressure dsitribution in each column and the overall pressure drop across the core
- the temperature rise of the bypassflow is a 30\% of the overall coolant temperature rise
- the core power distribution is an input for POKE. The power distribution is based on care-physics calculations perfromed for the reference GT-MHR.
Burnable posion is zoned axially.
- Local power density is determined by multiplying the average power density by the product of a column-averaged power factor and axial power factor.
The axial power factor is a strong function of control rod position
- Power distribution at time point between the middle and end of cycle when the control rods are inserted to the axial midpoint of the active core.
This type of power distribution generally results in higher fuel temperatures since more power is shifted toward the bottom where coolant temperatures are also the highest.
- Power distributions can be flattened if a concept referred to as fuel placement is used. With this method, each column contains both new and old fuel at the beginning of an equilibrium cycle.

* RELAP5-3D/ATHENA model:
	- (Figure 60) illustrates the heat transfer mechanisms modeled between the various structures and the coolant
	- Inner reflector and core: conduction, He: convection, Outer reflector to reactor vessel and reactor vessel to RCCS: convection and radiation
	- Transient analysis: HPCC and LPCC

Decay Heat
* ANS-5.1 is not appropriate for this reactor

* TAC2D for carrying parametric studies during a LPCC event
