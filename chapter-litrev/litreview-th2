ABSTRACT
The complex geometry of the hexagonal fuel assembly hinders accurate evaluations of the temperature profile without elaborate numerical calculations.
Several studies have used simplified approaches to reduce the computational time.
The unit cell model is an example of such approaches.
Such model does not consider the radial power distribution within the fuel assembly or the bypass flow between assemblies.
Such simplifications may affect the maximun fuel temperature.
The authors conducted a 3D \gls{CFD} analysis on a typical prismatic HTGR fuel assembly.
The authors compare the accuracy of the unit cell model against the CFD solutions.

INTRODUCTION
HTGR advantages are an inherent safety, high thermal efficiency, and a high temperature process heat potential.
Higher fuel temperature achieves higher outlet temperature.
However, undesirably high temperatures jeopardize the integrity of the TRISO particles (as well as the fission products release).
The design limit in HTGR is 1250 C. (check)

The analysis of prismatic \gls{HTGR} has widely used simplified computational models, among which we find the equivalent cylinder model and the unit cell model.

Several studies have adopted the equivalent cylinder model:
* NO et al. 2007 % no_multi-component_2007
* Reza et al. 2006 % reza_design_2006
* Nakano et al. 2007 % nakano_conceptual_2008

Several studies have solved the multi-dimensional head conduction based on the unit cell model:
* Bays et al. 2006
* In et al. 2006 % in_three-dimensional_2006
* Richards et al. 2007 % richards_thermal_2007
The unit cell model assumes that the heat generated in the fuel is only removed by the coolant.

Such simplified approaches are helpful to understand some basic aspects of prismatic fuel blocks.
Thermal-hydraulic evaluations of prismatic fuels using more detailed models than the unit cell model are rare, particularly in the open literature.

General Atomics analyzed detailed thermal behaviors of the fuel blocks of HTGRs using a model named DEMISE but limited information is available in the book written by Melese and Katz (1984).
* Melese and Katz 1984

Using a CFD code named Trio_U, Cioni et al. (2004) made three-dimensional thermo-fluid simulations of prismatic fuel assemblies of a HTGR.
They modeled seven fuel assemblies in detail and paid attention to the heat transfer between the fuel assemblies with/without a blockage of the coolant channels.
* Cioni et al. 2004

Simoneau et al. (2005) numerically analyzed the passive heat removal characteristics of a prismatic VHTR using a commercial CFD code.
They applied a simplified three-dimensional reactor model.
They used homogenized triangular posts since they were interested in the overall system behavior.

DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PRISMATIC FUEL ASSEMBLY
The analysis focuses on the fuel assembly of the PMR600, whose reference reactor is the GT-MHR (cite GA?)

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
The model includes a 1/12 th section of the fuel due to its symmetry.
The authors impose a uniform power density profile for the simulations.
The study determines the flow distribution using the one-dimensional hydraulic equations.
The calculation assumes the same pressure drop across the entire height of the reactor core.
Re = 40000 in coolant channel and 2000 in bypass gap.

The commercial code CFX 11 (cite ANSYS Inc) performed the CFD calculations.

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The innermost fuel and coolant channels reach the highest temperatures.
The temperature of the bypass region is close to that of the adjacent graphite block.
A large temperature gradient at the top and bottom of the active core show that the axial conduction through the reflectors is not significant.
The bypass flow is comparable to the average coolant exit temperature.
This suggests that the bypass flow contributes effectively to the cooling of the heat generated in the fuel compacts.

A comparison against the unit cell model shows that its overall predictions are reasonable.
However, by neglecting the heat transfer within the assembly, the model underpredicts the maximum fuel temperature by 20$^{\circ}$C.

The fast neutron irradiation causes dimensional changes in graphite.
Therefore, the bypass gap size varies with the fuel burn-up.
The authors conducted a parametric study in which they analyzed the impact of the bypass gap size on the maximum fuel temperature.
Increasing the bypass flow gap increases the maximum fuel temperature.
The results of this study indicate that the accuracy of the unit cell worsens for larger gaps.

The last study imposes different radial peaking factors for the different fuel channels.
Such a study shows the effects of considering a non-flat radial power distribution.
The radial power distribution considered by the authors does not have a strong impact on the maximum fuel temperature.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The unit cell model is a reasonable approximation if the bypass flow is small and the radial power profile within the assembly is uniform.

ABSTRACT
The geometry of the graphite blocks changes over the lifetime of the reactor because of thermal expansion and irradiation damage.
They conducted three-dimensional \gls{CFD} calculations of a typical prismatic \gls{HTGR} to better understand the bypass flow phenomena.
They used the commercial CFD code FLUENT.

They carry out parametric calculations changing several factors on a one-twelfth portion of a fuel column.
Factors include bypass gap-width, turbulence model, axial heat generation profile and geometry change due to irradiation-induced shrinkage in the graphite block region.
The bypass flow provides a significant cooling effect on the prismatic block.
The maximum fuel and coolant channel outlet temperatures increases with an increase in gap-width.
Applying a peak radial factor to the heat generation rate affects the outlet temperature.
The presence of bypass flow causes a large lateral temperature gradient in the block.
Large temperature gradients cause excessive thermal stresses which raise potential structural issues.

INTRODUCTION
Reactor core design has widely applied simplified approaches such as flow network calculations and unit cell models.
* Takada et al 2004
* Nakano et al 2008

Tak et al. 2008
The coolant mass flow was computed using a separate one-dimensional code.
The mass flow rates are determined as part of the solution in the present study.

FLUENT (citation)

REFERENCE PRISMATIC VHTR
The GT-MHR (GA citation 1996) is the reference reactor for the calculations.
The non-uniform neutron fluences and temperature distributions in the actual core cause non-uniform deformations in the graphite block over its lifetime, creating complex bypass flow pathways.

CORE BYPASS MODELING
The flow rates in the coolant channels are strong functions of the wall friction.
Parametric studies modify the following factors: gap-width, turbulence model, heat generation profile, geometry change of the blocks resulting from irradiations.

Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach.
Finite volume method.
Momentum, energy, and viscous terms are discretized using the second-order upwind scheme.
They used the algorithm SIMPLE for the Pressure-velocity coupling.

Tak et al set mass flow rates for each channel and gap as determined from a separate one-dimensional code.
However, the friction in the channels is dependent on the viscosity which is highly dependent on the temperature.
Therefore the mass flow rates are a function of the thermal characteristics of the problem, which are not known a priori.

THERMAL PROPERTIES:
Graphite: H-451 graphite.
Fuel compact properties:
* MacDonald et al. 2003
* Johnson et al. 2010

VALIDATION STUDY:
The study used two turbulence models: $k \sim \varepsilon$ and $k \sim \omega$.

The friction factor is a major factor affecting flow distribution in the fuel column.
They compared the computed wall shear stress for the turbulence models with empirical correlations.

Past studies:
* Shehata and McEligot 1995
* Mikielewicz et al 2002
* McEligot and Jackson 2004
have shown that the heat transfer and wall friction of strongly heated internal gas flow can be significantly affected by buoyancy or acceleration because of property variation.
Some turbulence models cannot predict well the correct velocity and temperature profiles in such situations.
In the present study, representative acceleration parameters (kV) and Jackson buoyancy parameters (Bo) are less thatn 1e-6 and 1e-7, respectively.
Hence, those effects are considered negligible.

The friction factors are corrected for variable fluid properties by the expression given by Schlichting and Gersten (2000).
(It seems that this will be useful).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF TURBULENCE MODELS
Bulk mean temperatures for the k–omega model case are considerably lower than those for the k–epsilon model.
Differences go up to 49$^{\circ}$C.
The overall mass flow rate is about 10% greater for the k–omega model compared to the k– e model.

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF HEAT GENERATION PROFILES
In a prismatic \gls{HTGR}, the heat generation rate is not uniform.
They apply a non-uniform heat generation rates in the axial direction at average and peak radial factors.
The profile is a chopped sine.
Comparison against the uniform profile case.
Bulk mean temperatures and mass flow rates for the cases of uniform and axial variation at the average radial factor are almost the same.
The differences in maximum fuel temperatures between the cases of uniform and axial variation at the peak radial factor are 160 $^{\circ}$C.
Mass flow rates for the case of axial variation at the peak radial factor are significantly lower than for the other cases.

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF GEOMTRY CHANGES IN BLOCK REGION
Fuel column including upper and lower reflectors, is shrunk by 1.23% in the radial direction and by 2.35% in axial direction uniformly.
These are the maximum dimensional changes experienced by H-451 graphite from irradiation.
The shrinkage increases the gap-width, decreases the diameter of the coolant channels, and decreases the length of the column.

Significantly higher temperatures are observed in the solid region for the no-shrinkage case (max fuel temperature decreases by 63 C), although temperatures in the coolant regions show only small differences between the two cases (within 9 C).
A lower gap outlet temperature is observed for the shrinkage case because the gap flow is higher.
Mass flow rates for the two cases are also not significantly different except in the gap region where the case with shrinkage is considerably higher.

ABSTRACT
The air ingress event following a LOCA is a cause of concern.
Following the depressurization of helium in the core, there exists the potential for air to enter the core through the break and oxidize the in-core graphite structure.
This study developed the code GAMMA.
The authors assessed its performance using a two-bulb experiment.
Following, they investigated the guillotine break of the main pipe between the reactor vessel and the power conversion unit.
As part of the study, they improved the code RELAP5 for the \gls{HTGR} air ingress analysis.

DEVELOPMENT AND ASSESMENT OF GAMMA CODE
The GAMMA code solves multi-dimensional heat conduction, multi-dimensional fluid flow, chemical reactions, and multi-component molecular diffusion, fluid heat transfer and pressure drop, and radiation heat transfer.

GENERAL FEATURES OF GAMMA CODE
The code solves two set of equations for both the gas and the solid parts.
The basic equations use the porous media model formulation to consider the heat transport in solid-fluid mixed components.
Porous media:
* Nield and Bejan 1999

Together with the multi-dimensional analysis feature, GAMMA has one-dimensional analysis capability modeling a general network of pipe flow.

The code solves the fueled zone one-dimensional heat conduction equation.
The heat transport between the fluid and the solid uses the hea transper relation: qsf = h(TWall - TFluid).

The code also considers the radiative heat transfer by using an irradiation/radiosity method
* Holman 1986
which assumes that the radiation exchange between surfaces is gray and diffuse.

ASSESSMENT OF THE ONSET TIME OF NATURAL CIRCULATION (OTNC)
They used GAMMA to predict the onset time of the natural circulation in the inverse U-tube experiment.

Another study chose the GT-MHR reactor as a reference plant.
Assesment that considers different reactor cavity free volumes and different average temperatures for the RCCS surface.
2D geometry models to consider the multi-dimensional flow and heat transport.
They compared the OTNC and the naturual circulation flow for each case.


RELAP5/ATHENA CODE IMPROVEMENTS:
They improved the code RELAP5/ATHENA (INEEL, 2005) by implementing models for molecular diffusion and graphite oxidation.
The molecular diffusion model calculates the diffusion of several species of gas using a network of control volumes.
They conducted the validation of the models using theoretical and experimental results.

RELAP5 ASSESSMENT
The code was validated using molecular data from an inverted U-tube experiment and natural circulation data for flow through a pebble bed.

CONCLUSIONS
The RELAP5 code has been improved significantly for the analysis of the VHTR.
The improvements allow the code to simulate air ingress following LOCAs due to the effects of molecular diffusion.
