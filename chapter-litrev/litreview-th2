ABSTRACT
The complex geometry of the hexagonal fuel assembly hinders accurate evaluations of the temperature profile  without elaborate numerical calculations.
Therefore, simplified models such as a unit cell model have been widely applied for the analyses and designs of prismatic VHTRs since they have been considered as effective approaches reducing the computational efforts.
The unit cell model is an effective approach that reduces the computational efforts.
However, such model neglects the effects of the bypass gap flow and the radial power distribution within the fuel assembly.
In this paper, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been carried out on a typical fuel assembly of a prismatic VHTR.
The accuracy of the unit cell approach is assessed against the CFD solutions.
Two example situations are illustrated to demonstrate the deficiency
of the unit cell model caused by neglecting the effects of the bypass gap flow and the radial power
distribution within the fuel assembly.

INTRODUCTION
HTGR advantages are an inherent safety, high thermal efficiency, and a high temperature process heat potential.
Higher fuel temperature achieves higher outlet temperature.
However, undesirably high temperatures jeopardize the integrity of the TRISO particles (as well as the fission products release).
The design limit in HTGR is 1250 C. (check)

Complex geometry of the fuel blocks hinders accurate evaluations of the fuel temperatures requiring elaborate numerical calculations.

The analyses and design of prismatic reactors has widely used simplified computational models, among which we find the equivalent cylinder model and the unit cell model.

The equivalent cylinder model has been widely adopted in the thermo-fluid analyses using one-dimensional and multi-dimensional system codes:
* NO et al. 2007 % no_multi-component_2007
* Reza et al. 2006 % reza_design_2006
* Nakano et al. 2007 % nakano_conceptual_2008

Solved the multi-dimensional head conduction based on the unit cell model:
* Bays et al. 2006
* In et al. 2006 % in_three-dimensional_2006
* Richards et al. 2007 % richards_thermal_2007
The unit cell model assumes that the heat generated in the fuel is only removed by the coolant.

Such simplified approaches are helpful to understand some basic aspects of a heat transfer in prismatic fuel blocks, and they are economical by reducing the computational efforts.
However, the simplified approaches cannot consider a heat transfer within a fuel assembly as well as a coolant flow through a gap between the fuel assemblies, which may significantly affect the fuel temperature.

Evaluations of the thermal behavior of prismatic fuels using more detailed thermo-fluid models than the unit cell model are rare, particularly in the open literatures.
General Atomics analyzed detailed thermal behaviors of the fuel blocks of HTGRs using a model named DEMISE but limited information is available in the book written by Melese and Katz (1984).

Using a CFD code named Trio_U, Cioni et al. (2004) made three-dimensional thermo-fluid simulations of prismatic fuel assemblies of a HTGR.
They modeled seven fuel assemblies in detail and paid attention to a heat transfer between the fuel assemblies with/without a blockage of the coolant channels.

Simoneau et al. (2005) numerically analyzed the passive heat removal characteristics of a prismatic VHTR using a commercial CFD code.
They applied a simplified three-dimensional reactor model.
They used homogenized triangular posts since they were interested in the overall system behavior.

PMR600: the reference reactor is GT-MHR.
The heat generated in the fuel compacts is conducted through the graphite block and it is finally removed by the helium coolant.

Considering the effects of the dowel holes to be negligible, a 1/12 section of the fuel is enough to simulate the fuel assembly due to its symmetry.
The model includes the graphite plugs.
Uniform power density profile.
The burnup flattens out the axial power profile making it close to uniform at the end of cycle.
Amount of heat generation in the graphite plugs is negligibly small.

Re = 40000 in coolant channel and 2000 in bypass gap.
Increasing the bypass flow gap increases the fuel temperature.
The unit cell model is a reasonable approximation if the bypass flow is small and the radial power profile within the assembly is uniform.

What they did:
* three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis carried out on a typical fuel assembly of a prismatic HTGR
* results used to assess the accuracy of the unit cell model
* examine the deviation from the results by the unit cell approach due to the bypass flow between fuel assemblies and radial power variations within the fuel assembly
* flow split a the upper plenum into the flow channels is obtained by a 1D calculation by assuming the same pressure drop across the entire height of the reactor core including top and bottom reflector blocks.
* calculated flow rate is used as an inlet boundary condition for the CFD analysis.
* CFD analysis using CFX 11 (ANSYS Inc.)
* Highest temperature: 1119 C.
* Max coolant velocity 51 m/s
* Pressure drop: 25 kPa
