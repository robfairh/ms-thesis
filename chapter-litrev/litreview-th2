ABSTRACT
The complex geometry of the hexagonal fuel assembly hinders accurate evaluations of the temperature profile without elaborate numerical calculations.
Several studies have used simplified approaches to reduce the computational time.
The unit cell model is an example of such approaches.
Such model does not consider the radial power distribution within the fuel assembly or the bypass flow between assemblies.
Such simplifications may affect the maximun fuel temperature.
The authors conducted a 3D \gls{CFD} analysis on a typical prismatic HTGR fuel assembly.
The authors compare the accuracy of the unit cell model against the CFD solutions.

INTRODUCTION
HTGR advantages are an inherent safety, high thermal efficiency, and a high temperature process heat potential.
Higher fuel temperature achieves higher outlet temperature.
However, undesirably high temperatures jeopardize the integrity of the TRISO particles (as well as the fission products release).
The design limit in HTGR is 1250 C. (check)

The analysis of prismatic \gls{HTGR} has widely used simplified computational models, among which we find the equivalent cylinder model and the unit cell model.

Several studies have adopted the equivalent cylinder model:
* NO et al. 2007 % no_multi-component_2007
* Reza et al. 2006 % reza_design_2006
* Nakano et al. 2007 % nakano_conceptual_2008

Several studies have solved the multi-dimensional head conduction based on the unit cell model:
* Bays et al. 2006
* In et al. 2006 % in_three-dimensional_2006
* Richards et al. 2007 % richards_thermal_2007
The unit cell model assumes that the heat generated in the fuel is only removed by the coolant.

Such simplified approaches are helpful to understand some basic aspects of prismatic fuel blocks.
Thermal-hydraulic evaluations of prismatic fuels using more detailed models than the unit cell model are rare, particularly in the open literature.

General Atomics analyzed detailed thermal behaviors of the fuel blocks of HTGRs using a model named DEMISE but limited information is available in the book written by Melese and Katz (1984).

Using a CFD code named Trio_U, Cioni et al. (2004) made three-dimensional thermo-fluid simulations of prismatic fuel assemblies of a HTGR.
They modeled seven fuel assemblies in detail and paid attention to the heat transfer between the fuel assemblies with/without a blockage of the coolant channels.

Simoneau et al. (2005) numerically analyzed the passive heat removal characteristics of a prismatic VHTR using a commercial CFD code.
They applied a simplified three-dimensional reactor model.
They used homogenized triangular posts since they were interested in the overall system behavior.

DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PRISMATIC FUEL ASSEMBLY
The analysis focuses on the fuel assembly of the PMR600, whose reference reactor is the GT-MHR (cite GA?)

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
The model includes a 1/12 th section of the fuel due to its symmetry.
The authors impose a uniform power density profile for the simulations.
The study determines the flow distribution using the one-dimensional hydraulic equations.
The calculation assumes the same pressure drop across the entire height of the reactor core.
Re = 40000 in coolant channel and 2000 in bypass gap.

The commercial code CFX 11 (cite ANSYS Inc) performed the CFD calculations.

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The innermost fuel and coolant channels reach the highest temperatures.
The temperature of the bypass region is close to that of the adjacent graphite block.
A large temperature gradient at the top and bottom of the active core show that the axial conduction through the reflectors is not significant.
The bypass flow is comparable to the average coolant exit temperature.
This suggests that the bypass flow contributes effectively to the cooling of the heat generated in the fuel compacts.

A comparison against the unit cell model shows that its overall predictions are reasonable.
However, by neglecting the heat transfer within the assembly, the model underpredicts the maximum fuel temperature by 20$^{\circ}$C.

The fast neutron irradiation causes dimensional changes in graphite.
Therefore, the bypass gap size varies with the fuel burn-up.
The authors conducted a parametric study in which they analyzed the impact of the bypass gap size on the maximum fuel temperature.
Increasing the bypass flow gap increases the maximum fuel temperature.
The results of this study indicates that the accuracy of the unit cell worsens for larger gaps.

The last study imposes different radial peaking factors for the different fuel channels.
Such a study shows the effects of considering a non-flat radial power distribution.
The radial power distribution considered by the authors does not have a strong impact on the maximum fuel temperature.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The unit cell model is a reasonable approximation if the bypass flow is small and the radial power profile within the assembly is uniform.
