Historically, stand-alone simulations have solved the neutronics and thermal-hydraulics of \glspl{HTGR}.
Nonetheless, these physical aspects describe processes that rely heavily on one another.
Hence, to consider the interaction between the neutronics and thermal-fluids behavior, a coupled analysis is necessary /cite{tak_cappgamma_2016}.

Damian et al. \cite{damian_vhtr_2008} conducted a study aimed at understanding the physical aspects of the annular core and the passive safety features of a standard block type \gls{HTGR}.
They performed the analysis of various geometrical scales: fuel cell and fuel column located at the core hot spot, 2D and 3D core configurations including the coupling between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics.

The first part of the assessment concerns thermal calculations on steady-state core configurations.
Such study used CAST3M \cite{studer_cast3marcturus_2007} code considering a 3D thermal coupled with 1D hydraulic modeling.
The authors conducted a parametric study on the maximum fuel temperature by modifying the fuel compact and the fuel element geometries.
An annular fuel compact and the reduction of the number of fuel compacts in the outer ring yielded the best performance.

The second part of the assessment used a 2D core configuration using the transport code APOLLO2 \cite{sanchez_apollo2_1999} to minimize the radial power peaking factor.
The analysis included the variation of various parameters such as fuel enrichment, fuel loading, and the fuel management scheme.
The fuel enrichment variation had the strongest impact.

The last part of the study analyzed a 3D core model using the coupled codes NEPTHIS \cite{cavalier_presentation_2005} and CAST3M/Arcturus.
The study varies several design parameters and studies the impact on the power distribution.
Such parameters are the helium by-pass fraction, average power density, core geometry, reflector materials, and fuel loading strategy.
The codes NEPTHIS and CAST3M/Arcturus calculate the neutronics and the thermal-hydraulics, respectively.
NEPHTIS uses a transport-diffusion calculation scheme that relies on APOLLO2 and the diffusion code CRONOS2 \cite{lautard_cronos_1990}.
The CRONOS2 code solves either the diffusion equation or the even parity transport equation, and it uses a \gls{FDM} or a \gls{FEM} discretization.
The CAST3M/Arcturus model uses a two-level approach.
On the first level, the porous media model solves the homogenized system and the coolant.
On the second level, the CAST3M code solves the thermal-hydraulics on the homogenized geometry.
Some of the conclusions of this last part of the study were that although the reduction of the bypass fraction decreases the maximum fuel temperature, the average reflector temperature rises.
Another conclusion showed that using magnesium oxide for the reflector material yields lower temperatures for both normal operation and transients.
