Historically, stand-alone simulations have solved the neutronics and thermal-hydraulics of \glspl{HTGR}.
Nonetheless, these physical aspects describe processes that rely heavily on one another.
Hence, to consider the interaction between the neutronics and thermal-hydraulics behavior, a coupled analysis is necessary /cite{tak_cappgamma_2016}.

% damian_vhtr_2008
In 2008, Damian et al. \cite{damian_vhtr_2008} conducted a study aimed at understanding the physical aspects of the annular core and the passive safety features of a prismatic \gls{HTGR}.
They performed analyses on various geometrical scales: unit cell and fuel column located at the core hot-spot, two-dimensional and three-dimensional core configurations including the coupling between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics.
The first part of the assessment concerns thermal calculations on steady-state core configurations.
Such study used CAST3M \cite{studer_cast3marcturus_2007} code to solve the three-dimensional heat conduction in the solid coupled to the one-dimensional thermal-hydraulic equations in the coolant.
% The authors conducted a parametric study on the maximum fuel temperature by modifying the fuel compact and the fuel element geometries.
% An annular fuel compact and the reduction of the number of fuel compacts in the outer ring yielded the best performance.
The second part of the assessment used the transport code APOLLO2 \cite{sanchez_apollo2_1999} on a two-dimensional core configuration to minimize the radial power peaking factor.
The analysis included the variation of several parameters such as fuel enrichment, fuel loading, and the fuel management scheme.
The fuel enrichment variation had the strongest impact.
The last part of the study analyzed a three-dimensional core model using the coupled codes NEPTHIS \cite{cavalier_presentation_2005} and CAST3M/Arcturus.
The codes NEPTHIS and CAST3M/Arcturus calculate the neutronics and the thermal-hydraulics, respectively.
NEPHTIS uses a transport-diffusion calculation scheme that relies on APOLLO2 and the diffusion code CRONOS2.
The CRONOS2 code solves either the diffusion equation or the even parity transport equation, and it uses a \gls{FDM} or a \gls{FEM} discretization.
The CAST3M/Arcturus model uses a two-level approach.
On the first level, the porous media model solves the homogenized system and the coolant.
On the second level, the CAST3M code solves the thermal-hydraulics on the homogenized geometry.
The authors conducted several parametric studies and assessed their impact on the power distribution.
The studies included the variation of the helium by-pass fraction, average power density, core geometry, reflector materials, and fuel loading strategy.
One of their results exhibited that with the reduction of the bypass fraction the average reflector temperature rises.
Another result showed that using magnesium oxide as the reflector material yields lower temperatures for both normal operation and transients.

% CAPP
In 2011, Lee et al. published an article \cite{lee_development_2011} in which they extended the functionalities of the CAPP code to prismatic \glspl{HTGR}.
To take into account the thermal feedback, the authors integrated to CAPP a simplified thermal-hydraulics tool.
This tool divides a fuel column into six triangular prisms.
Each of them hosts a representative coolant channel.
Solving the energy equation, the code calculates the axial coolant temperature distribution.
After calculating the coolant temperature, a two-dimensional conduction model solves the moderator and fuel compact temperatures.
By means of a TRISO particle conduction model, the model obtains the fuel temperature.
Finally, a three-dimensional conduction model based on the \gls{FDM} allows for solving the reflector temperature.
% The cross-sections are a function of burnup, moderator temperature, and fuel temperature.
To validate their model, the authors solved a two-dimensional model of the PMR-200 at \gls{BOC}.
They compared the results against the HELIOS code reference results.
The results showed good accuracy.

% tak_coupled_2016
Tak et al. \cite{tak_coupled_2016} developed a neutronics/thermal-hydraulics coupled code using DeCART \cite{kaeri_decart_2007} and CORONA.
DeCART is a whole-core neutron transport code and it was responsible for calculating the power distribution and the fast neutron fluence.
CORONA calculated the temperature distribution.
To validate the new code, the authors conducted the OECD/NEA MHTGR-350 benchmark.
The main objective of the exercise was to validate the code and also identify technical challenges for future development.
The authors presented an interesting analysis in which they compared the results from the coupled simulation and the stand-alone simulations.
The difference in the multiplication factor was as high as 2597 pcm.
The axial offset and maximum fuel temperature exhibited significant differences as well.
Such result highlights the importance of the integration of both neutronics and thermal-hydraulic solvers.

% tak_cappgamma_2016
Another article \cite{tak_cappgamma_2016} introduced a coupling between the CAPP code and the GAMMA+ code.
GAMMA+ is a system code for thermo-fluids analysis and system transients.
GAMMA+'s development main motivation was the analysis of the air ingress accident and thermo-fluid transients in \glspl{HTGR}.
The code uses the one-dimensional form of the mass, momentum, energy, and species conservation equations to solve the flow and temperature distribution of the fluid.
For solids, the code uses three different models: (1) heat conduction model of a TRISO particle, (2) implicit coupling to consider the heat exchange between a fuel compact and TRISO particle, and (3) multi-dimensional heat conduction model of the hexagonal fuel and reflector blocks.
In such study, the authors applied the coupled code to study the steady-state performance of the PMR-200.
They analyzed the bypass flow effects on the coupled calculations.
Some of their most relevant results showed that the maximum fuel temperature reaches a peak near \gls{MOC}.
Another result revealed that neglecting the bypass flow decreases the active core temperatures and increases the reflector temperatures.
Consequently, the multiplication factor increased by approximately 300 pcm.
On the other hand, the power density changes were not appreciable.

% yuk_time-dependent_2020
A recent article by Yuk et al. \cite{yuk_time-dependent_2020} added the capability to conduct transient analyses to the reactor physics code CAPP.
To take into account the thermal feedback, the authors developed a simplified thermal-hydraulics analysis tool.
The tool divides a fuel column into six triangular prisms.
Each of them hosts a representative coolant channel.
After calculating the coolant temperature, a two-dimensional conduction model solves the moderator and fuel compact temperatures.
The CAPP code uses predetermined tables of thermal conductivity for each material.
For a given fast neutron fluence and temperature, the code obtains the thermal conductivity by interpolation.
To test the new transient capabilities, they analyzed two control rod ejection scenarios.
They compared the results to those of the CAPP/GAMMA+ coupled code.
Both methods showed similar results.
