Historically, stand-alone simulations have solved the neutronics and thermal-hydraulics of \glspl{HTGR}.
Nonetheless, these physical aspects describe processes that rely heavily on one another.
Hence, to consider the interaction between the neutronics and thermal-fluids behavior, a coupled analysis is necessary /cite{tak_cappgamma_2016}.

% damian_vhtr_2008
In 2008, Damian et al. \cite{damian_vhtr_2008} conducted a study aimed at understanding the physical aspects of the annular core and the passive safety features of a prismatic \gls{HTGR}.
They performed analyses on various geometrical scales: unit cell and fuel column located at the core hot-spot, two-dimensional and three-dimensional core configurations including the coupling between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics.
The first part of the assessment concerns thermal calculations on steady-state core configurations.
Such study used CAST3M \cite{studer_cast3marcturus_2007} code to solve the three-dimensional heat conduction in the solid coupled to the one-dimensional thermal-hydraulic equations in the coolant.
% The authors conducted a parametric study on the maximum fuel temperature by modifying the fuel compact and the fuel element geometries.
% An annular fuel compact and the reduction of the number of fuel compacts in the outer ring yielded the best performance.
The second part of the assessment used the transport code APOLLO2 \cite{sanchez_apollo2_1999} on a two-dimensional core configuration to minimize the radial power peaking factor.
The analysis included the variation of several parameters such as fuel enrichment, fuel loading, and the fuel management scheme.
The fuel enrichment variation had the strongest impact.
The last part of the study analyzed a three-dimensional core model using the coupled codes NEPTHIS \cite{cavalier_presentation_2005} and CAST3M/Arcturus.
The codes NEPTHIS and CAST3M/Arcturus calculate the neutronics and the thermal-hydraulics, respectively.
NEPHTIS uses a transport-diffusion calculation scheme that relies on APOLLO2 and the diffusion code CRONOS2.
The CRONOS2 code solves either the diffusion equation or the even parity transport equation, and it uses a \gls{FDM} or a \gls{FEM} discretization.
The CAST3M/Arcturus model uses a two-level approach.
On the first level, the porous media model solves the homogenized system and the coolant.
On the second level, the CAST3M code solves the thermal-hydraulics on the homogenized geometry.
The authors conducted several parametric studies and assessed their impact on the power distribution.
The studies included the variation of the helium by-pass fraction, average power density, core geometry, reflector materials, and fuel loading strategy.
One of their results exhibited that with the reduction of the bypass fraction the average reflector temperature rises.
Another result showed that using magnesium oxide as the reflector material yields lower temperatures for both normal operation and transients.

% CAPP
In 2011, Lee et al. published an article \cite{lee_development_2011} in which they extended the functionalities of the CAPP code to prismatic \glspl{HTGR}.
To take into account the thermal feedback, the authors integrated to CAPP a simplified thermal-hydraulics tool.
This tool divides a fuel column into six triangular prisms.
Each of them hosts a representative coolant channel.
Solving the energy equation, the code calculates the axial coolant temperature distribution.
After calculating the coolant temperature, a two-dimensional conduction model solves the moderator and fuel compact temperatures.
By means of a TRISO particle conduction model, the model obtains the fuel temperature.
Finally, a three-dimensional conduction model based on the \gls{FDM} allows for solving the reflector temperature.
% The cross-sections are a function of burnup, moderator temperature, and fuel temperature.
To validate their model, the authors solved a two-dimensional model of the PMR-200 at \gls{BOC}.
They compared the results against the HELIOS reference results.
The results showed good accuracy.
