	abstract = {The variational principle used to derive finite element approximations to the even-parity neutron transport equation is modified to include the odd parity flux as a Lagrange multiplier along the interelement boundaries. The result is a functional that guarantees nodal balance over each element or node, regardless of the form of the space-angle trial functionsthat are used. Ritzprocedures are employedto yieldnodal methods that are analogous to those usedextensivelyin diffusiontheory, but without the need for ad-hoc node-to-node interpolation of transverse leakage terms. With spherical harmonics, nodal transport methods are obtained with consistent angular approximations within the nodes and across the node interfaces.The resulting equations are in response matrix form, and from their solution the detailed flux distribution as well as the node-averaged values can be obtained.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in the development of coarse-mesh nodal methods for the numerical solution of the neutron diffusionand transport equations is reviewed.In contrast with earlier nodal simulators, more recent nodal diffusionmethods are characterized by the systematicderivation of spatial coupling relationships that are entirely consistent with the multigroup diffusion equation. These relationships most often are derived by developing approximations to the one-dimensionalequations obtained by integrating the multidimensionaldiffusionequation over directions transverse to each coordinate axis. Both polynomial and analytic approaches to the solution of the transverse-integrated equations are discussed, and the Cartesian-geometry polynomial approach is derived in a manner which motivates the extension of this formulation to the solution of the diffusionequation in hexagonal geometry. Iterative procedures developed for the solution of the nodal equations are discussed briefly, and numerical comparisons for representative three-dimensional benchmark problems are given. The application of similar ideas to the neutron transport equation has led to the development of coarse-mesh transport schemes that combine nodal spatial approximations with angular representations based on either the standard discrete-ordinate approximation or double P, expansions of the angular dependenceof the fluxeson the surfaces of the nodes. The former methods yield improved difference approximations to the multidimensional discrete-ordinates equations, while the latter approach leads to equations similar to those obtained in interfacecurrent nodal-diffusionformulations. The relativeeflicienciesof these two approaches are discussed,and directions for future work are indicated.},

The code HEXNOD allows an accurate and efficient calculation of three-dimensional problems for fast reactors and high converter light water reactors. A unique capability of HEXNOD is the accurate solution of global three-dimensional neutron transport problems for fast reactors with very small computing times. The accuracy of the nodal diffusion and transport approximations is demonstrated by comparison with conventional finite difference methods and Monte Carlo calculations for a number of mathematical benchmark problems. Based on numerical results, it is concluded that the code HEXNOD is well suited for three-dimensional routine analysis of fast reactors and, in particular, as the neutronics module of the generalized quasi-static kinetics program HEXNODYN, which is currently being developed as part of the European accident code EAC-2.},

	title = {Deterministic {Modeling} of the {High} {Temperature} {Test} {Reactor} with {DRAGON}-{HEXPEDITE}},
	abstract = {The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is tasked with the development of reactor physics analysis capability of the Next Generation Nuclear Power (NGNP) project. In order to examine the INL’s current prismatic reactor analysis tools, the project is conducting a benchmark exercise based on modeling the High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR). This exercise entails the development of a model for the initial criticality, a 19 fuel column thin annular core, and the fully loaded core critical condition with 30 fuel columns. Special emphasis is devoted to physical phenomena and artifacts in HTTR that are similar to phenomena and artifacts in the NGNP base design. The DRAGON code is used in this study since it offers significant ease and versatility in modeling prismatic designs. DRAGON can generate transport solutions via Collision Probability (CP), Method of Characteristics (MOC) and Discrete Ordinates (Sn). A fine group cross-section library based on the SHEM 281 energy structure is used in the DRAGON calculations. The results from this study show reasonable agreement in the calculation of the core multiplication factor with the MC methods, but a consistent bias of 2–3\% with the experimental values is obtained. This systematic error has also been observed in other HTTR benchmark efforts and is well documented in the literature. The ENDF/B VII graphite and U235 cross sections appear to be the main source of the error. The isothermal temperature coefficients calculated with the fully loaded core configuration agree well with other benchmark participants but are 40\% higher than the experimental values. This discrepancy with the measurement partially stems from the fact that during the experiments the control rods were adjusted to maintain criticality, whereas in the model, the rod positions were fixed. In addition, this work includes a brief study of a cross section generation approach that seeks to decouple the domain in order to account for neighbor effects. This spectral interpenetration is a dominant effect in annular HTR physics. This analysis methodology should be further explored in order to reduce the error that is systematically propagated in the traditional generation of cross sections.},

	abstract = {The finite element method is a procedure for reducing partial differential equations to sets of simultaneous algebraic equations suitable for solution on a digital computer. The method consists of several steps. The differential equation first is cast into the form of a variational principle, and the domain of the resulting functional is partitioned into a number of subdomains or finite elements. The dependent variable then is approximated within each element by a simple polynomial, and these are linked across inter-element boundaries by appropriate continuity conditions. Such an approximation may be represented as a sum of piecewise polynomial trial functions with unknown coefficients that typically correspond to the values of the dependent variable and possibly its derivatives at mesh points defined by the finite element structure. The requirement that the functional be stationary with respect to variations in these coefficients then leads to the desired set of simultaneous equations.},

	abstract = {The complex geometry of the hexagonal fuel blocks of the prismatic fuel assembly in a very high temperature reactor (VHTR) hinders accurate evaluations of the temperature proﬁle within the fuel assembly without elaborate numerical calculations. Therefore, simpliﬁed models such as a unit cell model have been widely applied for the analyses and designs of prismatic VHTRs since they have been considered as effective approaches reducing the computational efforts. In a prismatic VHTR, however, the simpliﬁed models cannot consider a heat transfer within a fuel assembly as well as a coolant ﬂow through a bypass gap between the fuel assemblies, which may signiﬁcantly affect the maximum fuel temperature. In this paper, a three-dimensional computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been carried out on a typical fuel assembly of a prismatic VHTR. Thermal behaviours and heat transfer within the fuel assembly are intensively investigated using the CFD solutions. In addition, the accuracy of the unit cell approach is assessed against the CFD solutions. Two example situations are illustrated to demonstrate the deﬁciency of the unit cell model caused by neglecting the effects of the bypass gap ﬂow and the radial power distribution within the fuel assembly.},

The predicted boron concentration at the core inlet of the reactor shows that the potential return to criticality might not be excluded in the case of a small break LOCA. Further neutronic calculations are necessary to conﬁrm this result.},

The present aim is to investigate an emergency situation due to the blocking of few Helium channels in the core. In this situation, some Helium channels for coolant passage are blocked and the related issue is the temperature distribution within the assemblies, as well as the locations of the local extrema in graphite and fuel media, that must not exceed 1600 ◦C. Two conﬁgurations are investigated, depending on the situation of the blocked fuel assembly in the core. The blocked assembly is surrounded by six unblocked fuel assemblies in the ﬁrst situation and by ﬁve unblocked fuel assemblies and one reﬂector assembly in the second situation.},

The interstitial gaps are an inherent presence in the reactor core because of tolerances in manufacturing the blocks and the inexact nature of their installation. Furthermore, the geometry of the graphite blocks changes over the lifetime of the reactor because of thermal expansion and irradiation damage. The occurrence of hot spots in the core and lower plenum and hot streaking in the lower plenum (regions of very hot gas ﬂow) are affected by bypass ﬂow.},

A CFD analysis will help determine if the scaled model is a suitable geometry for validation data. The present article describes the development of an analysis plan for the CFD model. The plan examines the boundary conditions that should be used, the extent of the computational domain that should be included and which turbulence models need not be examined against the data. Calculations are made for a closely related 2D geometry to address these issues. It was found that a CFD model that includes only the inside of the scaled model in its computational domain is adequate for CFD calculations. The realizable k{\textasciitilde}İ model was found not to be suitable for this problem because it did not predict vortex-shedding.},

	abstract = {The very high temperature reactor (VHTR) system behavior should be predicted during normal operating conditions and postulated accident conditions. The plant accident scenario and the passive safety behavior should be accurately predicted. Uncertainties in passive safety behavior could have large effects on the resulting system characteristics. Due to these performance issues in the VHTR, there is a need for development, testing and validation of design tools to demonstrate the feasibility of the design concepts and guide the improvement of the plant components. One of the identiﬁed design issues for the gas-cooled reactor is the thermal mixing of the coolant exiting the core into the outlet plenum. Incomplete thermal mixing may give rise to thermal stresses in the downstream components. To provide ﬂow details, the analysis presented in this paper was performed by coupling a VHTR model generated in a thermal hydraulic systems code to a computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) outlet plenum model. The outlet conditions obtained from the systems code VHTR model provide the inlet boundary conditions to the CFD outlet plenum model. By coupling the two codes in this manner, the important three-dimensional ﬂow effects in the outlet plenum are well modeled while avoiding modeling the entire reactor with a computationally expensive CFD code. The values of pressure, mass ﬂow rate and temperature across the coupled boundary showed differences of less than 5\% in every location except for one channel. The coupling auxiliary program used in this analysis can be applied to many different cases requiring detailed three-dimensional modeling in a small portion of the domain.},

	abstract = {A Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is designed to generate high temperature which is typically around 950 °C at the outlet. The high temperature results in thermal stress with dimensional changes in addition to the mechanical stress caused by the external loads. It is necessary to assess the structural integrity of the graphite blocks and fuel compacts for thermal stress and dimensional changes; however, precise assessment has not been conducted because of the complexity of the fuel assembly geometry and absence of accurate temperature distribution. In the present study, a ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) of each fuel element in a 10-story fuel assembly was carried out by using the temperature distribution which was calculated from a previous study of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) analysis on the fuel assembly. The results showed that the maximum stress level in the fuel elements reaches 32\% of the tensile strength. The maximum stress point was at the circumference of the bottom surface of a graphite plug on which the thermal expansion of the fuel compacts pushes up the graphite plug. Mitigation of the maximum stress by placing a small gap between the graphite plug and the fuel compact was investigated and the effect of the gap was conﬁrmed. Stress evaluation was performed according to a draft of standard for nuclear graphite. All stress components lied within the limits and the structural integrity was regarded to be attained.},
