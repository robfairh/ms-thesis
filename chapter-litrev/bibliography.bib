	abstract = {The complex geometry of the hexagonal fuel blocks of the prismatic fuel assembly in a very high temperature reactor (VHTR) hinders accurate evaluations of the temperature proﬁle within the fuel assembly without elaborate numerical calculations. Therefore, simpliﬁed models such as a unit cell model have been widely applied for the analyses and designs of prismatic VHTRs since they have been considered as effective approaches reducing the computational efforts. In a prismatic VHTR, however, the simpliﬁed models cannot consider a heat transfer within a fuel assembly as well as a coolant ﬂow through a bypass gap between the fuel assemblies, which may signiﬁcantly affect the maximum fuel temperature. In this paper, a three-dimensional computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been carried out on a typical fuel assembly of a prismatic VHTR. Thermal behaviours and heat transfer within the fuel assembly are intensively investigated using the CFD solutions. In addition, the accuracy of the unit cell approach is assessed against the CFD solutions. Two example situations are illustrated to demonstrate the deﬁciency of the unit cell model caused by neglecting the effects of the bypass gap ﬂow and the radial power distribution within the fuel assembly.},

	abstract = {A loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) has been considered a critical event for very high temperature gas-cooled reactor (VHTR). Following helium depressurization, it is anticipated that unless countermeasures are taken, air will enter the core through the break by molecular diffusion and ultimately by natural convection leading to oxidation of the in-core graphite structure. Thus, without any mitigating features, a LOCA will lead to an air ingress event, which will lead to exothermic chemical reactions of graphite with oxygen, potentially resulting in signiﬁcant increases of the core temperature.},

This model, developed using the STAR-CD general computational ﬂuid dynamics code, solves the combined conductive, convective, and radiative heat transfer within a 30◦ section of the core and reactor vessel. To accommodate the different spatial scales, it uses homogeneous equivalent media to represent the coolant ﬂow and the prismatic fuel blocks. A customized procedure that manages solving alternatively the dynamic and thermal ﬁelds permits the computation of very long transients, which typically are performed for 100 or more hours of simulated time.},

A density driven ROCOM experiment as well as an UPTF Tram-C3 experiment have been used for the qualiﬁcation of the Trio U code. Both experiments present similar thermal hydraulic conditions as the reactor case. The predicted boron concentration at the core inlet of the reactor shows that the potential return to criticality might not be excluded in the case of a small break LOCA. Further neutronic calculations are necessary to conﬁrm this result.},

Two conﬁgurations are investigated, depending on the situation of the blocked fuel assembly in the core. The blocked assembly is surrounded by six unblocked fuel assemblies in the ﬁrst situation and by ﬁve unblocked fuel assemblies and one reﬂector assembly in the second situation.},
