	abstract = {The variational principle used to derive finite element approximations to the even-parity neutron transport equation is modified to include the odd parity flux as a Lagrange multiplier along the interelement boundaries. The result is a functional that guarantees nodal balance over each element or node, regardless of the form of the space-angle trial functionsthat are used. Ritzprocedures are employedto yieldnodal methods that are analogous to those usedextensivelyin diffusiontheory, but without the need for ad-hoc node-to-node interpolation of transverse leakage terms. With spherical harmonics, nodal transport methods are obtained with consistent angular approximations within the nodes and across the node interfaces.The resulting equations are in response matrix form, and from their solution the detailed flux distribution as well as the node-averaged values can be obtained.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in the development of coarse-mesh nodal methods for the numerical solution of the neutron diffusionand transport equations is reviewed.In contrast with earlier nodal simulators, more recent nodal diffusionmethods are characterized by the systematicderivation of spatial coupling relationships that are entirely consistent with the multigroup diffusion equation. These relationships most often are derived by developing approximations to the one-dimensionalequations obtained by integrating the multidimensionaldiffusionequation over directions transverse to each coordinate axis. Both polynomial and analytic approaches to the solution of the transverse-integrated equations are discussed, and the Cartesian-geometry polynomial approach is derived in a manner which motivates the extension of this formulation to the solution of the diffusionequation in hexagonal geometry. Iterative procedures developed for the solution of the nodal equations are discussed briefly, and numerical comparisons for representative three-dimensional benchmark problems are given. The application of similar ideas to the neutron transport equation has led to the development of coarse-mesh transport schemes that combine nodal spatial approximations with angular representations based on either the standard discrete-ordinate approximation or double P, expansions of the angular dependenceof the fluxeson the surfaces of the nodes. The former methods yield improved difference approximations to the multidimensional discrete-ordinates equations, while the latter approach leads to equations similar to those obtained in interfacecurrent nodal-diffusionformulations. The relativeeflicienciesof these two approaches are discussed,and directions for future work are indicated.},

The code HEXNOD allows an accurate and efficient calculation of three-dimensional problems for fast reactors and high converter light water reactors. A unique capability of HEXNOD is the accurate solution of global three-dimensional neutron transport problems for fast reactors with very small computing times. The accuracy of the nodal diffusion and transport approximations is demonstrated by comparison with conventional finite difference methods and Monte Carlo calculations for a number of mathematical benchmark problems. Based on numerical results, it is concluded that the code HEXNOD is well suited for three-dimensional routine analysis of fast reactors and, in particular, as the neutronics module of the generalized quasi-static kinetics program HEXNODYN, which is currently being developed as part of the European accident code EAC-2.},

	abstract = {A modiﬁed, hybrid nodal-integral/ﬁnite-element method (NI-FEM) is developed to solve the threedimensional (3D), steady-state, convection-diffusion problems in arbitrary geometries. The hybrid NI-FEM takes advantage of the high efﬁciency of the conventional nodal-integral method (NIM) and the ﬂexible mesh generation of the ﬁnite element method (FEM), which is applicable to arbitrary geometries. In this method, the computational domain is discretized into, for 3D problems, four-node tetrahedral elements and eight-node cuboid elements. The cuboid elements are used to discretize the interior region and regions adjacent to boundaries that are parallel to planes formed by two of the axes, while the tetrahedral elements are used to discretize the remaining irregular regions. The conventional NIM is used to develop difference equations for the transverse-averaged variables on the interface between two adjacent cuboid elements. The FEM is applied to develop algebraic equations for the node temperatures of tetrahedral elements. On the interface between two different kinds of elements, the transverseaveraged variable for the cuboid element is obtained by averaging the node values of its adjacent tetrahedral elements, while the heat ﬂux for the tetrahedral element is calculated using the corresponding transverse-averaged variables of its adjacent cuboid element. The hybrid NI-FEM is developed to be solved using a matrix formulation for the entire domain rather than an iterative procedure, detailed derivations of which for the 3D case are presented in this paper. Using the NI-FEM developed here, 2D and 3D convection-diffusion test problems are solved, and the numerical results are compared to the exact (manufactured) solutions to determine the order, accuracy and efﬁciency of the method. Numerical scheme is found to be of, as expected, second order.},

	abstract = {The finite element method is a procedure for reducing partial differential equations to sets of simultaneous algebraic equations suitable for solution on a digital computer. The method consists of several steps. The differential equation first is cast into the form of a variational principle, and the domain of the resulting functional is partitioned into a number of subdomains or finite elements. The dependent variable then is approximated within each element by a simple polynomial, and these are linked across inter-element boundaries by appropriate continuity conditions. Such an approximation may be represented as a sum of piecewise polynomial trial functions with unknown coefficients that typically correspond to the values of the dependent variable and possibly its derivatives at mesh points defined by the finite element structure. The requirement that the functional be stationary with respect to variations in these coefficients then leads to the desired set of simultaneous equations.},

In this work, a code system for a coupled neutronics and thermo-ﬂuids simulation was developed using CAPP (reactor physics code) and GAMMA+ (thermo-ﬂuid system code). Using the code system developed, coupled neutronics and thermo-ﬂuid simulations were carried out for a prismatic very high temperature reactor (VHTR) core to extend the knowledge about the coupled behavior.

	abstract = {The safety of gas cooled reactors (High Temperature Reactors (HTR), Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTR) or Gas Cooled Fast Reactors (GFR)) must be ensured by systems (active or passive) which maintain loads on component (fuel) and structures (vessel, containment) within acceptable limits under accidental conditions. To achieve this objective, thermal–hydraulics computer codes are necessary tools to design, enhance the performance and ensure a high safety level of the different reactors. Some key safety questions are related to the evaluation of decay heat removal and containment pressure and thermal loads. This requires accurate simulations of conduction, convection, thermal radiation transfers and energy storage. Coupling with neutronics is also an important modeling aspect for the determination of representative parameters such as neutronics coefﬁcient (Doppler coefﬁcient, Moderator coeffcient, . . .), critical position of control rods, reactivity insertion aspects, . . .. For GFR, the high power density of the core and its necessary reduced dimension cannot rely only on passive systems for decay heat removal. Therefore, forced convection using active safety systems (gas blowers, heat exchangers, . . .) are highly recommended. Nevertheless, in case of station black-out, the safety demonstration of the concept should be guaranteed by natural circulation heat removal. This could be performed by keeping a relatively high back-up pressure for pure helium convection and also by heavy gas injection. So, it is also necessary to model mixing of different gases, the on-set of natural convection and the pressure and thermal loads onto the proximate or guard containment. In this paper, we report on the developments of the CAST3M/ARCTURUS thermal–hydraulics (Lumped Parameter and CFD) code developed at CEA, including its coupling to the neutronics code CRONOS2 and the system code CATHARE. Elementary validation cases are detailed, as well as application of the code to benchmark problems such as the HTR-10 thermal–hydraulic exercise. Examples of containment thermal–hydraulics calculations for fast reactor design (GFR) are also detailed. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The complex geometry of the hexagonal fuel blocks of the prismatic fuel assembly in a very high temperature reactor (VHTR) hinders accurate evaluations of the temperature proﬁle within the fuel assembly without elaborate numerical calculations. Therefore, simpliﬁed models such as a unit cell model have been widely applied for the analyses and designs of prismatic VHTRs since they have been considered as effective approaches reducing the computational efforts. In a prismatic VHTR, however, the simpliﬁed models cannot consider a heat transfer within a fuel assembly as well as a coolant ﬂow through a bypass gap between the fuel assemblies, which may signiﬁcantly affect the maximum fuel temperature. In this paper, a three-dimensional computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been carried out on a typical fuel assembly of a prismatic VHTR. Thermal behaviours and heat transfer within the fuel assembly are intensively investigated using the CFD solutions. In addition, the accuracy of the unit cell approach is assessed against the CFD solutions. Two example situations are illustrated to demonstrate the deﬁciency of the unit cell model caused by neglecting the effects of the bypass gap ﬂow and the radial power distribution within the fuel assembly.},

	abstract = {A pebble bed geometry is usually adopted for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), which exhibits inherently safe performance, high conversion efﬁciency, and low power density design. It is important to understand the thermal-hydraulic characteristics of HTGR core for optimum design and safe operation. Therefore, this study investigates the thermal-hydraulic behaviors in a segment of pebbles predicted by the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) model using porous and realistic approaches for the complicated geometry. The advantages of each approach’s methodology for the closely packed pebble geometry can be revealed by comparing the calculated results. In an engineering application, a CFD simulation with the porous approach for the pebble geometry can quickly and reasonably capture the averaged behaviors of the thermal-hydraulic parameters as the gas ﬂows through the core, including the pressure drop and temperature increase. However, it is necessary to utilize the realistic approach for this complicated geometry to obtain the detailed and localized characteristics within the ﬂuid and solid fuel regions. The present simulation results can provide useful information to help CFD researchers to determine an appropriate approach to be used when investigating the thermal-hydraulic characteristics within the reactor core of a closely packed pebble bed.},

The CORONA code is targeted for whole-core thermo-fluid analysis of a prismatic gas cooled reactor, with fast computation and reasonable accuracy. In order to achieve this target, the development of CORONA focused on (1) an efficient numerical method, (2) efficient grid generation, and (3) parallel computation. The key idea for the efficient numerical method of CORONA is to solve a three-dimensional solid heat conduction equation combined with one-dimensional fluid flow network equations. The typical difficulties in generating computational grids for a whole core analysis were overcome by using a basic unit cell concept. A fast calculation was finally achieved by a block-wise parallel computation method. The objective of the present paper is to summarize the motivation and strategy, numerical approaches, verification and validation, parallel computation, and perspective of the CORONA code.},

	abstract = {Presented are the results of thermal–hydraulics analyses for a Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) 1/6 core and hexagonal fuel element, with and without helium-coolant bypass ﬂow in interstitial gaps and in the control rod channels. Owing to the complexity and massive size of the VHTR, a full core analysis requires extensive and parallelized computation capabilities and a long time (weeks to months) to complete. These demanding requirements are mostly due to the 3-D computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the helium ﬂow in the 10-m long coolant channels in the reactor core. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of coupling a 1-D helium ﬂow in the channels together with a recently developed and validated convective heat transfer correlation, to a 3-D heat conduction in the graphite and fuel compacts in the core fuel elements. This simpliﬁed thermal–hydraulics analysis methodology for VHTR markedly reduces computation time and memory requirements, while maintaining accurate results. The helium bypass ﬂow in interstitial gaps between fuel elements in the VHTR core provides additional cooling of the edge regions, but increases the temperature near the center of the prismatic fuel elements. Results also show that helium ‘‘bleed’’ ﬂow through the control rod channels minimally affects the temperature distribution within the fuel elements. The heat generation in the corner burnable poison rods in the VHTR core fuel elements affects the temperature only in the close vicinity of the rods.},

A density driven ROCOM experiment as well as an UPTF Tram-C3 experiment have been used for the qualiﬁcation of the Trio U code. Both experiments present similar thermal hydraulic conditions as the reactor case. The predicted boron concentration at the core inlet of the reactor shows that the potential return to criticality might not be excluded in the case of a small break LOCA. Further neutronic calculations are necessary to conﬁrm this result.},

The plan examines the boundary conditions that should be used, the extent of the computational domain that should be included and which turbulence models need not be examined against the data. Calculations are made for a closely related 2D geometry to address these issues. It was found that a CFD model that includes only the inside of the scaled model in its computational domain is adequate for CFD calculations. The realizable k{\textasciitilde}İ model was found not to be suitable for this problem because it did not predict vortex-shedding.},

	abstract = {The very high temperature reactor (VHTR) system behavior should be predicted during normal operating conditions and postulated accident conditions. The plant accident scenario and the passive safety behavior should be accurately predicted. Uncertainties in passive safety behavior could have large effects on the resulting system characteristics. Due to these performance issues in the VHTR, there is a need for development, testing and validation of design tools to demonstrate the feasibility of the design concepts and guide the improvement of the plant components. One of the identiﬁed design issues for the gas-cooled reactor is the thermal mixing of the coolant exiting the core into the outlet plenum. Incomplete thermal mixing may give rise to thermal stresses in the downstream components. To provide ﬂow details, the analysis presented in this paper was performed by coupling a VHTR model generated in a thermal hydraulic systems code to a computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) outlet plenum model. The outlet conditions obtained from the systems code VHTR model provide the inlet boundary conditions to the CFD outlet plenum model. By coupling the two codes in this manner, the important three-dimensional ﬂow effects in the outlet plenum are well modeled while avoiding modeling the entire reactor with a computationally expensive CFD code. The values of pressure, mass ﬂow rate and temperature across the coupled boundary showed differences of less than 5\% in every location except for one channel. The coupling auxiliary program used in this analysis can be applied to many different cases requiring detailed three-dimensional modeling in a small portion of the domain.},

The high temperature results in thermal stress with dimensional changes in addition to the mechanical stress caused by the external loads. It is necessary to assess the structural integrity of the graphite blocks and fuel compacts for thermal stress and dimensional changes; however, precise assessment has not been conducted because of the complexity of the fuel assembly geometry and absence of accurate temperature distribution. In the present study, a ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) of each fuel element in a 10-story fuel assembly was carried out by using the temperature distribution which was calculated from a previous study of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) analysis on the fuel assembly. The results showed that the maximum stress level in the fuel elements reaches 32\% of the tensile strength. The maximum stress point was at the circumference of the bottom surface of a graphite plug on which the thermal expansion of the fuel compacts pushes up the graphite plug. Mitigation of the maximum stress by placing a small gap between the graphite plug and the fuel compact was investigated and the effect of the gap was conﬁrmed. Stress evaluation was performed according to a draft of standard for nuclear graphite. All stress components lied within the limits and the structural integrity was regarded to be attained.},
