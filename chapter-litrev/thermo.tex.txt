% sort of motivation
Thermal-hydraulic calculations enable the correct design of \glspl{HTGR}.
The ability to predict the maximum fuel temperature at steady-state is of paramount importance to succeed in such task.
We emphasize this statement in the case hydrogen production is desirable.
Efficient hydrogen production requires higher coolant temperatures, which in turn increases the temperature of the fuel and the reactor pressure vessel.

% sort of intro to simplified models
The complex geometry of the hexagonal fuel assembly requires elaborate numerical calculations for obtaining accurate evaluations.
Thermal-hydraulic studies for early \glspl{HTGR} consisted mainly of support calculations for \gls{NRC} safety analysis reports.
The analyses employed sets of independent codes that relied on simplistic approximations.
Simplified models are helpful to understand some basic aspects of prismatic \glspl{HTGR} and have the advantage to reduce the computational expense of the calculations.

% shenoy_htgr_1974
General Atomics \cite{shenoy_htgr_1974} developed the first set of simplistic codes.
The following list introduces and summarizes some of these codes and their features:

\begin{itemize}
\item FLAC: It determines the coolant flow distribution in the coolant channels and gaps.
It solves the one-dimensional momentum equation for incompressible flow and the continuity equations for mass and energy.

\item POKE: It determines the coolant mass flow, coolant temperature, and fuel temperature distribution.
It solves the steady-state mass and momentum conservation equations for parallel channels.

\item DEMISE: It determines the steady-state three-dimensional temperature distribution in a standard element.
It solves the temperature in a network model.

\item TAC-2D: It is a general purpose two-dimensional thermal analysis code.
It solves the two-dimensional heat conduction equation.
\end{itemize}

Several studies have used these codes.
% macdonald_ngnp_2003
For example, \gls{INL} conducted in 2003 a design study \cite{macdonald_ngnp_2003} in support to the \gls{NGNP} project.
The objective of such study was to investigate options for the NGNP that increased the coolant temperature, with the lowest possible inlet temperature, and the highest overall core power.
The authors conducted several parametric studies whose reference reactor was the GT-MHR \cite{general_atomics_gas_1996}.
Using the code POKE, they evaluated two major design modifications: reducing the bypass flow and better controlling the inlet coolant flow distribution.
Reducing the bypass flow fraction from 20 to 10$\%$ reduces the peak fuel temperatures by about 50$^{\circ}$C.
Controlling the inlet flow distribution has a stronger effect.
Other studies focused on the dimensions of the reactor and their impact on the maximum fuel temperature.
Using the computer codes POKE and TAC2D, the authors investigated taller and higher power reactor cores.
The investigation included a 10-block-high 600 MWt, a 12-block-high 720 MWt, and 14-block-high 840 MWt.

Among the simplified approaches we differentiate the flow network model, the equivalent cylindrical model, and the unit cell model.
% flow network model
% reza_design_2006
Using the network analysis tool RELAP5-3D/ATHENA \cite{inl_relap5-3dathena_2005}, Reza et al. \cite{reza_design_2006} conducted a thermal hydraulic study of the GT-MHR.
Reza et al. increased the reactor outlet temperature to enable hydrogen production.
Additionally, they evaluated alternative coolant inflow paths in an attempt to reduce the reactor vessel temperatures.
After finding an optimal configuration, they evaluated the maximum temperatures in the fuel and the reactor vessel during the \gls{LPCC} and the \gls{HPCC} events.

% equivalent cylindrical model
% no_multi-component_2007
An example of codes using the equivalent cylindrical approach is GAMMA \cite{no_multi-component_2007}.
The code’s main objective is the modeling of the air ingress event following a LOCA.
Following the depressurization of helium in the core, there exists the potential for air to enter the core through the break and oxidize the in-core graphite structure.
The oxidation of graphite leads to exothermic chemical reactions and, thus, it is a major concern.
The GAMMA code solves heat conduction, fluid flow, chemical reactions, and multi-component molecular diffusion.
The code couples the solid and gas equations using the porous media model.
Together with the multi-dimensional analysis feature, GAMMA has a one-dimensional analysis capability for  modeling a flow network.

% takada_core_2004
Takada et al. \cite{takada_core_2004} carried out another study using the flow network and the equivalent cylindrical model.
Focusing on the \gls{HTTR}, they developed a thermal-hydraulic design code.
The code used the flow network analysis code FLOWNET \cite{maruyama_verification_1988} for calculating the coolant flow and temperature distributions.
The code TEMDIM \cite{maruyama_verification_1988} solved the fuel temperatures using the equivalent cylindrical model.
Finally, the authors validated the calculation scheme by comparing its results with the experimental data from the \gls{HTTR}.

% unit cell model
% nakano_conceptual_2008
Nakano et al. \cite{nakano_conceptual_2008} studied different fuel assembly configurations using several simplistic approximations.
For determining the fuel temperature, they used the TAC-2D code.
A previous nuclear analysis calculated the power density.
And a previous study calculated the flow distribution using the code FLOWNET.
The fuel temperature calculation used the equivalent cylindrical model for a hot channel unit cell.
However, the asymmetry of the unit cell configuration makes the temperature distribution asymmetric in the graphite block.
The equivalent cylindrical model fails to capture this behavior.

% in_three-dimensional_2006
In 2006, In et al. \cite{in_three-dimensional_2006} conducted a more detailed analysis using a three-dimensional model of the unit cell in the hot-spot of an \gls{HTGR}.
The objective of the study was to predict the maximum fuel temperature at steady-state.
The analysis focused on the GT-MHR 600 at \gls{EOC}.
The CFD code CFX 10 \cite{ansys_inc_cfx_2006} calculated the three-dimensional temperature profile.







Such simplified approaches are helpful to understand some basic aspects of prismatic \glspl{HTGR} but they may affect the temperature distribution.

Although the unit cell model simplifies the analysis, it is a helpful tool to determine some basic parameters of the reactor under surveying.
In such a study, the results showed that the maximum fuel temperature surpassed the design limits and the authors propose accordingly a countermeasure.


% leave this for Tak et al 2008
The unit cell model assumes that the coolant removes all the heat generated in the fuel.
The model does not consider the radial power distribution within the fuel assembly or the bypass flow between assemblies.
