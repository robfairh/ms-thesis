	abstract = {Time and action are of the essence to deploy the first micro-reactor for a U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) domestic installation before the end of 2027. Micro-reactors are a source of resilient energy that
can enable a wide range of DoD installations to enhance their range, endurance, agility and mission assurance. Micro-reactors are being designed with island-mode operations, black-start capabilities, an ability to protect against severe natural phenomena as well as man-made physical and cyber security threats, and to operate for several years without the need to shutdown for refueling.},
