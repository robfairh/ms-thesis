	abstract = {Time and action are of the essence to deploy the first micro-reactor for a U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) domestic installation before the end of 2027. Micro-reactors are a source of resilient energy that
can enable a wide range of DoD installations to enhance their range, endurance, agility and mission assurance. Micro-reactors are being designed with island-mode operations, black-start capabilities, an ability to protect against severe natural phenomena as well as man-made physical and cyber security threats, and to operate for several years without the need to shutdown for refueling.},

	abstract = {Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has been conducting a study on a thermochemical IS process for hydrogen production. A pilot test of IS process is under planning that covers four R\&D subjects: (1) construction of a pilot test plant made of industrial materials and completion of a hydrogen production test using electrically-heated helium gas as the process heat supplier, (2) development of an analytical code system, (3) component tests to assist the hydrogen production test and also to improve the process performance for the commercial plant, (4) a design study of HTTR-IS system. Development of innovative chemical reactors is in progress, which are equipped with a ceramic heat exchanger. In the design of the IS plant, it is important to establish the system for ‘‘design by analysis’’. Therefore, we have developed a multiphase ﬂow analysis code that can analyze systems in which chemical reactions occur.},
