	abstract = {The C YCLUS Fuel Cycle Simulator [1] is a framework
for assessment of nuclear fuel cycle options. While C Y -
CLUS has previously been capable of system transitions
from the current fuel cycle strategy to a future option, those
transitions have never previously been driven by market
forces in the simulation. This summary describes a set
of libraries [2] that have been contibuted to the C YCLUS
framework to enable a market-driven transition analysis.
This simulation framework is incomplete without a suite
of dynamically loadable libraries representing the process
physics of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e. mining, fuel fabri-
cation, chemical processing, transmutation, reprocessing,
etc.). Within Cycamore [3], the additional modules reposi-
tory within the C YCLUS ecosystem, provides some basic li-
braries to represent these processes. However, extension of
C YCLUS with new capabilities is community-driven, rely-
ing on contributions by user-developers. The libraries con-
tributed in this work are examples of such contributions.},

	abstract = {Small Modular Reactor of few mega watts range meets power need at remote area when it can be 'factory manufactured' and extremely safe. We have developed a concept of Micro Modular Reactor based on the FCM compact fuel which has superior safety characteristics. We have made a preliminary neutronic analysis to confirm the long life time which is essential for remote application, and to check the controllability based on the criticality analysis. A core of 200 cm diameter and 200 cm or 300 cm long cylinder shape can achieve the core life of 5 ∼ 10 years with 20 ∼ 10\% LEU. When the rated power is reduced by design, the service period can be extended to 20 ∼ 40 years. (author)},

	abstract = {This study investigated the random arrangement effect of coated fuel particles (CFPs) on the criticality of the fuel compact of the high-temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR). A utility program coupled with MCNP6, namely the realized random packing (RRP) model, was developed to explicitly model the random arrangement of CFPs in a specified fuel compact of the HTTR. The criticality and neutronic calculations for a pin cell model were performed using the Monte Carlo MCNP6 code with ENDF/B-VII.1 neutron library data. The reliability of the RRP model was confirmed by the insignificant variance of the infinite multiplication factor (kinf) among 10 different random arrangements of the CFPs. Next, the criticality of the RRP model was compared with those of a non-truncated uniform packing (NUP) model and an on-the-fly random packing (ORP) model, which is a stochastic geometry capability in MCNP6. The results indicated that there was no substantial difference between the NUP and ORP models. However, the RRP model presented a lower kinf (by about 0.32–0.52\%Δk/k) than the NUP model. In addition, the difference in kinf was increased as uranium enrichment decreased. Investigation of the 4-factor formula showed that the difference in kinf was predominantly a result of the resonance escape probability, with the RRP model showing the smallest value.},

	abstract = {The flow field characteristics are of fundamental importance in the design work of the pebble bed high temperature gas cooled reactor (HTGR). The different effects of bed configurations on the flow characteristics of pebble bed are studied through the PTV (Particle Tracking Velocimetry) experiment. Some criteria, e.g. flow uniformity (σ) and mass flow level (α), are proposed to estimate vertical velocity field and compare the bed configurations. The distribution of the Δθ (angle difference between the individual particle velocity and the velocity vector sum of all particles) is also used to estimate the resultant motion consistency level. Moreover, for each bed configuration, the thickness of displacement is analyzed to measure the effect of the funnel flow zone based on the boundary layer theory. Detailed information shows the quantified characteristics of bed configuration effects on flow uniformity and other characteristics; and the sequence of levels of each estimation criterion is obtained for all bed configurations. In addition, a good design of the pebble bed configuration is suggested and these estimation criteria can be also applied and adopted in testing other geometry designs of pebble bed.},

Within this scheme, three main types of HTR-10 core states including initial critical configuration, initial core and equilibrium core, have been established by using the continuous energy module named Tsunami-3D-K6 in SCALE6.2.1 to quantify the uncertainty of keff propagated from nuclear data. Then, the mechanism of the keff uncertainty difference deriving from the core models, temperature distributions, material compositions and different covariance libraries are analyzed in-depth. Meanwhile, some valuable observations have been made through the mechanism analysis and also the most significant contributors to the total keff uncertainty have been figured out for HTR-10.},

	abstract = {An optimization study of a single-pass transuranic (TRU) deep burn (DB) has been performed for a block-type modular helium reactor (MHR) proposed by General Atomics. A high-burnup TRU feed vector from light water reactors is considered: 50 GWd/tU burnup with 5-yr cooling. For threedimensional equilibrium cores, the performance analysis is done by using McCARD, a continuous-energy Monte Carlo depletion code. The core optimization is performed from the viewpoints of the core configuration, fuel management, tristructural-isotropic (TRISO) fuel specification, and neutron spectrum. With regard to core configuration, two annular cores are investigated in terms of the neutron economy. A conventional radial shuffling scheme of fuel blocks is compared with an axial-only block-shuffling strategy in terms of the fuel burnup and core power distributions. The impact of the kernel size of the TRISO fuel is evaluated, and a diluted kernel, instead of a conventional concentrated kernel, is introduced to maximize the TRU burnup by reducing the self-shielding effects of the TRISO particles. A higher graphite density is also evaluated in terms of the fuel burnup. In addition, it is shown that the core power distribution can be effectively controlled by a zoning of the packing fraction of the TRISO fuels. We also have shown that a long-cycle DB-MHR core can be designed by using a two- or three-batch fuel-reloading scheme, at the expense of only a marginal decrease of the TRU discharge burnup. Finally, preliminary safety characteristics of a DB-MHR core have been investigated in terms of the temperature coefficients and effective delayed neutron fraction. It has been found that, depending on the fuel management scheme and fuel specifications, the TRU burnup in an optimized DB-MHR core can be well over 60\% in a single-pass irradiation campaign.},
