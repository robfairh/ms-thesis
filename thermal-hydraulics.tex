Analysis with three axial power profiles.
A- Continuous cosine profile.
B- Discontinuous and uniform.
C- Axial power profile at EOC of the equilibrium core.
Sharp drops due to non fuel zones at the interfaces between the fuel blocks (graphite plugs and seats). Plugs and seats of 2 cm thickness located at the top and bottom positions of the fuel blocks.
