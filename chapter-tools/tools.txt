\section{Serpent}

The Serpent Monte Carlo code \cite{leppanen_development_2007} \cite{leppanen_calculation_2014} is a three-dimensional continuous-energy neutron transport code.
It was developed at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland an has been in public distribution since 2009.
Monte Carlo neutron transport codes have several reactor physics applications, traditionally related to criticality safety analyses, radiation shielding problems, detector modeling, and validation of deterministic transport codes.
The main advantage of the Monte Carlo method is its capability to model geometry and interaction physics without major approximations.
The main disadvantage is that modeling complex systems is very computing-intensive restricting the applications to some extent.

Serpent serves two main purposes: (1) reactor modeling, and (2) group constant generation.
In reactor modeling, the Monte Carlo simulation itself represents the solution to the full-scale problem.
In group constant generation, the transport simulation produces input parameters for a deterministic reactor simulation code.
Based on a few group diffusion methods, these codes allow for carrying out coupled full-core analyses.

In this work, Serpent’s objective is to produce cross section that will be an input for Moltres and generate results for validation of the neutronic calculations in Moltres.
For carrying out the calculations we used the version 2.1.31 of Serpent and the cross section library JEFF3.1.2.

\section{Benchmark specification}

In addition to the development of new methods, it is essential to define appropriate benchmarks to compare the capabilities of various computer codes.
The \gls{OECD}/\gls{NEA} defined such benchmark for the \gls{MHTGR}-350 MW reactor \cite{oecd_nea_benchmark_2017}.
The scope of the benchmark is twofold: (1) to establish a well-defined problem, based on a common given data set, to compare methods and tools in core simulation and thermal fluids analysis, and (2) to test the depletion capabilities of various lattice physics codes available for \glspl{PMR}.
The objective of this work is to conduct Exercise 1 of Phase I of the benchmark with Moltres.
