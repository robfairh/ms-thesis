\section{Preliminary studies}

This section carries out some preliminar studies using Moltres and MOOSE heat conduction module.

\section{Unit cell problem}

This section will solve the unit cell problem in the hot spot of an HTGR.

\section{Fuel assembly}

This section will calculate the heat profile of a fuel assembly of a HTGR.

\section{Full core}

This section will extend the methodology to a fullcore problem and it will inted to solve Exercise 2 of Phase I of the OECD/NEA MHTGR-350 Benchmark.




\section{Neutronics and Thermal-fluids Coupling}

3 options:
- Heterogeneous model
- Homogenized media and sub-channel unit cell model
- Porous media model
