The governing equations and material models applicable to particle fuel and implemented in BISON are outlined. Code veriﬁcation based on a recent IAEA benchmarking exercise is described, and excellent comparisons are reported. Multiple TRISO-coated particles of increasing geometric complexity are considered. The code’s ability to use the same algorithms and models to solve problems of varying dimensionality from 1D through 3D is demonstrated. The code provides rapid solutions of 1D spherically symmetric and 2D axially symmetric models, and its scalable parallel processing capability allows for solutions of large, complex 3D models. Additionally, the ﬂexibility to easily include new physical and material models and straightforward ability to couple to lower length scale simulations makes BISON a powerful tool for simulation of coated-particle fuel. Future code development activities and potential applications are identiﬁed.},

	abstract = {This century power engineering is facing up to one of the greatest challenges ever posed to humankind: the achievement of a sustainable energy system. In order to respond to this challenge, Nuclear Technology is designing a new generation of power plants termed Generation IV, among them High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors stand out for their potential capability to achieve an excellent thermal performance. This paper investigates the thermal and economic performance of several direct Brayton cycle configurations that could be used in future HTGRs, with special attention to the effects of intercooling and reheating. Among the hypotheses and assumptions taken, the adoption of the PBMR reactor parameters and settings as a reference is particularly important. All inter-cooled layouts have shown thermal efficiencies near or even higher than 50\%, which means a substantial improvement with respect to non-intercooled baselines with no economic penalties. Reheating has been shown not to affect remarkably the thermal or economic plant performance under base-load operation, but it provides the plant with such a flexibility that allows its operation under the “load-follow” regime without heavily taxing the thermal or economic performance. Anyway, use of a multiple axes configuration instead of a single one seems to worsen plant economics and not to entail any thermal benefit.},

	abstract = {Conventional coupling paradigms currently used to couple different physics components in reactor analysis problems can be inconsistent in their treatment of the nonlinear terms due to the operator-split (OS) strategies employed. This leads to the usage of small time steps to maintain accuracy requirements, thereby increasing the overall computational time. This paper proposes some remedies to OS techniques that can restore consistency in the coupling of the nonlinear terms and explores high-order mono-block nonlinearly consistent techniques with time step control. The performance of the methods was studied for several transient scenarios using a 0D point-kinetics/thermal-hydraulics lumped model and a 1D neutronics/heat conduction/enthalpy balance model. The results prove that consistent approximations can be made to enhance the overall accuracy in conventional codes with simple nonintrusive techniques. Additionally, an analysis of a mono-block coupling strategy (without having recourse to an OS strategy) is carried out to assess automated time stepping control using higher order Implicit Runge–Kutta (IRK) schemes. The conclusions from these results indicate that nonlinearly consistent adaptive time stepping methods can provide better accuracy and reliability in the solution ﬁelds than constant time stepping methods, even for transients with rapid and discontinuous variations.},

Expensive Jacobian matrix formation is alleviated via the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method, and physics-based preconditioning is applied to minimize Krylov iterations. Motivation for the work is provided via analysis and numerical experiments on simpler multiphysics reactor models. We then provide detail of the physical models and numerical methods in PRONGHORN. Finally, PRONGHORN’s algorithmic capability is demonstrated on a number of PBR test cases.},

This work compares VHTRC criticality simulations utilizing the Monte Carlo codes Serpent and SCALE/KENO-VI. Reasonable agreement was found between Serpent and KENO-VI, but only the use of the latest ENDF cross section library release, namely the ENDF/B-VII.1 library, led to an improved match with the measured data. Furthermore, the fourth beta release of SCALE 6.2/KENO-VI showed significant improvements from the current SCALE 6.1.2 version, compared to the experimental values and Serpent.},

	abstract = {The complex geometry of the hexagonal fuel blocks of the prismatic fuel assembly in a very high temperature reactor (VHTR) hinders accurate evaluations of the temperature proﬁle within the fuel assembly without elaborate numerical calculations. Therefore, simpliﬁed models such as a unit cell model have been widely applied for the analyses and designs of prismatic VHTRs since they have been considered as effective approaches reducing the computational efforts. In a prismatic VHTR, however, the simpliﬁed models cannot consider a heat transfer within a fuel assembly as well as a coolant ﬂow through a bypass gap between the fuel assemblies, which may signiﬁcantly affect the maximum fuel temperature. In this paper, a three-dimensional computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been carried out on a typical fuel assembly of a prismatic VHTR. Thermal behaviours and heat transfer within the fuel assembly are intensively investigated using the CFD solutions. In addition, the accuracy of the unit cell approach is assessed against the CFD solutions. Two example situations are illustrated to demonstrate the deﬁciency of the unit cell model caused by neglecting the effects of the bypass gap ﬂow and the radial power distribution within the fuel assembly.},
