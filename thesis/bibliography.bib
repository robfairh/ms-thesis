The governing equations and material models applicable to particle fuel and implemented in BISON are outlined. Code veriﬁcation based on a recent IAEA benchmarking exercise is described, and excellent comparisons are reported. Multiple TRISO-coated particles of increasing geometric complexity are considered. The code’s ability to use the same algorithms and models to solve problems of varying dimensionality from 1D through 3D is demonstrated. The code provides rapid solutions of 1D spherically symmetric and 2D axially symmetric models, and its scalable parallel processing capability allows for solutions of large, complex 3D models. Additionally, the ﬂexibility to easily include new physical and material models and straightforward ability to couple to lower length scale simulations makes BISON a powerful tool for simulation of coated-particle fuel. Future code development activities and potential applications are identiﬁed.},

	abstract = {This century power engineering is facing up to one of the greatest challenges ever posed to humankind: the achievement of a sustainable energy system. In order to respond to this challenge, Nuclear Technology is designing a new generation of power plants termed Generation IV, among them High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors stand out for their potential capability to achieve an excellent thermal performance. This paper investigates the thermal and economic performance of several direct Brayton cycle configurations that could be used in future HTGRs, with special attention to the effects of intercooling and reheating. Among the hypotheses and assumptions taken, the adoption of the PBMR reactor parameters and settings as a reference is particularly important. All inter-cooled layouts have shown thermal efficiencies near or even higher than 50\%, which means a substantial improvement with respect to non-intercooled baselines with no economic penalties. Reheating has been shown not to affect remarkably the thermal or economic plant performance under base-load operation, but it provides the plant with such a flexibility that allows its operation under the “load-follow” regime without heavily taxing the thermal or economic performance. Anyway, use of a multiple axes configuration instead of a single one seems to worsen plant economics and not to entail any thermal benefit.},

This leads to the usage of small time steps to maintain accuracy requirements, thereby increasing the overall computational time. This paper proposes some remedies to OS techniques that can restore consistency in the coupling of the nonlinear terms and explores high-order mono-block nonlinearly consistent techniques with time step control. The performance of the methods was studied for several transient scenarios using a 0D point-kinetics/thermal-hydraulics lumped model and a 1D neutronics/heat conduction/enthalpy balance model. The results prove that consistent approximations can be made to enhance the overall accuracy in conventional codes with simple nonintrusive techniques. Additionally, an analysis of a mono-block coupling strategy (without having recourse to an OS strategy) is carried out to assess automated time stepping control using higher order Implicit Runge–Kutta (IRK) schemes. The conclusions from these results indicate that nonlinearly consistent adaptive time stepping methods can provide better accuracy and reliability in the solution ﬁelds than constant time stepping methods, even for transients with rapid and discontinuous variations.},

Expensive Jacobian matrix formation is alleviated via the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method, and physics-based preconditioning is applied to minimize Krylov iterations. Motivation for the work is provided via analysis and numerical experiments on simpler multiphysics reactor models. We then provide detail of the physical models and numerical methods in PRONGHORN.

This work compares VHTRC criticality simulations utilizing the Monte Carlo codes Serpent and SCALE/KENO-VI. Reasonable agreement was found between Serpent and KENO-VI, but only the use of the latest ENDF cross section library release, namely the ENDF/B-VII.1 library, led to an improved match with the measured data. Furthermore, the fourth beta release of SCALE 6.2/KENO-VI showed significant improvements from the current SCALE 6.1.2 version, compared to the experimental values and Serpent.},

	abstract = {The complex geometry of the hexagonal fuel blocks of the prismatic fuel assembly in a very high temperature reactor (VHTR) hinders accurate evaluations of the temperature proﬁle within the fuel assembly without elaborate numerical calculations. Therefore, simpliﬁed models such as a unit cell model have been widely applied for the analyses and designs of prismatic VHTRs since they have been considered as effective approaches reducing the computational efforts. In a prismatic VHTR, however, the simpliﬁed models cannot consider a heat transfer within a fuel assembly as well as a coolant ﬂow through a bypass gap between the fuel assemblies, which may signiﬁcantly affect the maximum fuel temperature. In this paper, a three-dimensional computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been carried out on a typical fuel assembly of a prismatic VHTR. Thermal behaviours and heat transfer within the fuel assembly are intensively investigated using the CFD solutions. In addition, the accuracy of the unit cell approach is assessed against the CFD solutions. Two example situations are illustrated to demonstrate the deﬁciency of the unit cell model caused by neglecting the effects of the bypass gap ﬂow and the radial power distribution within the fuel assembly.},

These relationships most often are derived by developing approximations to the one-dimensionalequations obtained by integrating the multidimensionaldiffusionequation over directions transverse to each coordinate axis. Both polynomial and analytic approaches to the solution of the transverse-integrated equations are discussed, and the Cartesian-geometry polynomial approach is derived in a manner which motivates the extension of this formulation to the solution of the diffusionequation in hexagonal geometry. Iterative procedures developed for the solution of the nodal equations are discussed briefly, and numerical comparisons for representative three-dimensional benchmark problems are given. The application of similar ideas to the neutron transport equation has led to the development of coarse-mesh transport schemes that combine nodal spatial approximations with angular representations based on either the standard discrete-ordinate approximation or double P, expansions of the angular dependenceof the fluxeson the surfaces of the nodes. The former methods yield improved difference approximations to the multidimensional discrete-ordinates equations, while the latter approach leads to equations similar to those obtained in interfacecurrent nodal-diffusionformulations. The relativeeflicienciesof these two approaches are discussed,and directions for future work are indicated.},

	abstract = {Advanced nodal methods for the solution of the multigroup neutron diffusion and transport theory equations in three-dimensional hexagonal-z geometry are described. The code HEXNOD allows an accurate and efficient calculation of three-dimensional problems for fast reactors and high converter light water reactors. A unique capability of HEXNOD is the accurate solution of global three-dimensional neutron transport problems for fast reactors with very small computing times. The accuracy of the nodal diffusion and transport approximations is demonstrated by comparison with conventional finite difference methods and Monte Carlo calculations for a number of mathematical benchmark problems. Based on numerical results, it is concluded that the code HEXNOD is well suited for three-dimensional routine analysis of fast reactors and, in particular, as the neutronics module of the generalized quasi-static kinetics program HEXNODYN, which is currently being developed as part of the European accident code EAC-2.},

	abstract = {A modiﬁed, hybrid nodal-integral/ﬁnite-element method (NI-FEM) is developed to solve the threedimensional (3D), steady-state, convection-diffusion problems in arbitrary geometries. The hybrid NI-FEM takes advantage of the high efﬁciency of the conventional nodal-integral method (NIM) and the ﬂexible mesh generation of the ﬁnite element method (FEM), which is applicable to arbitrary geometries. In this method, the computational domain is discretized into, for 3D problems, four-node tetrahedral elements and eight-node cuboid elements. The cuboid elements are used to discretize the interior region and regions adjacent to boundaries that are parallel to planes formed by two of the axes, while the tetrahedral elements are used to discretize the remaining irregular regions. The conventional NIM is used to develop difference equations for the transverse-averaged variables on the interface between two adjacent cuboid elements. The FEM is applied to develop algebraic equations for the node temperatures of tetrahedral elements. On the interface between two different kinds of elements, the transverseaveraged variable for the cuboid element is obtained by averaging the node values of its adjacent tetrahedral elements, while the heat ﬂux for the tetrahedral element is calculated using the corresponding transverse-averaged variables of its adjacent cuboid element. The hybrid NI-FEM is developed to be solved using a matrix formulation for the entire domain rather than an iterative procedure, detailed derivations of which for the 3D case are presented in this paper. Using the NI-FEM developed here, 2D and 3D convection-diffusion test problems are solved, and the numerical results are compared to the exact (manufactured) solutions to determine the order, accuracy and efﬁciency of the method. Numerical scheme is found to be of, as expected, second order.},

A linear or bilinear ﬁnite element formulation for the reactor core and a linear boundary element technique for the reﬂector which are combined through interface continuity conditions constitute the basis of the developed method. The present formulation is restricted to two-dimensional geometries and has been implemented in the developed computer program. Via comparisons with analytical solutions, the proposed method has been validated. Further comparisons against the pure ﬁnite and boundary element formulations show that the proposed method constitutes a viable alternative for the numerical solution of neutron diﬀusion problems of both the external neutron source and multiplication eigenvalue determination variety.},

	abstract = {The finite element method is a procedure for reducing partial differential equations to sets of simultaneous algebraic equations suitable for solution on a digital computer. The method consists of several steps. The differential equation first is cast into the form of a variational principle, and the domain of the resulting functional is partitioned into a number of subdomains or finite elements. The dependent variable then is approximated within each element by a simple polynomial, and these are linked across inter-element boundaries by appropriate continuity conditions. Such an approximation may be represented as a sum of piecewise polynomial trial functions with unknown coefficients that typically correspond to the values of the dependent variable and possibly its derivatives at mesh points defined by the finite element structure. The requirement that the functional be stationary with respect to variations in these coefficients then leads to the desired set of simultaneous equations.},

They mainly focus on stand-alone analyses, although the neutronics and thermalﬂuids behavior affect each other. In order to consider the interaction between the neutronics and thermal-ﬂuids behavior, a coupled analysis is desirable. However, only a few studies are available in the open literature on the coupled analysis of a prismatic gas-cooled reactor core. In this work, a code system for a coupled neutronics and thermo-ﬂuids simulation was developed using CAPP (reactor physics code) and GAMMA+ (thermo-ﬂuid system code). Using the code system developed, coupled neutronics and thermo-ﬂuid simulations were carried out for a prismatic very high temperature reactor (VHTR) core to extend the knowledge about the coupled behavior. In particular, the effect of the bypass ﬂow modeling on the coupled behavior was analyzed.},

In the validation with a high-temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR)-simulated air ingress experiment, the onset times of natural convection are accurately predicted within a 10\% deviation. Small internal leaks in the HTTR-simulated test facility have been found to significantly affect the consequence of air ingress. In all the simulated cases for a SANA-1 afterheat removal test, the predictions of GAMMA are in a high level of agreement with the measured temperature profiles and are comparable to the results of other codes (TINTE, THERMIX/DIREKT, and TRIO-EF).},

	abstract = {The safety of gas cooled reactors (High Temperature Reactors (HTR), Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTR) or Gas Cooled Fast Reactors (GFR)) must be ensured by systems (active or passive) which maintain loads on component (fuel) and structures (vessel, containment) within acceptable limits under accidental conditions. To achieve this objective, thermal–hydraulics computer codes are necessary tools to design, enhance the performance and ensure a high safety level of the different reactors. Some key safety questions are related to the evaluation of decay heat removal and containment pressure and thermal loads. This requires accurate simulations of conduction, convection, thermal radiation transfers and energy storage. Coupling with neutronics is also an important modeling aspect for the determination of representative parameters such as neutronics coefﬁcient (Doppler coefﬁcient, Moderator coeffcient, . . .), critical position of control rods, reactivity insertion aspects, . . .. For GFR, the high power density of the core and its necessary reduced dimension cannot rely only on passive systems for decay heat removal. Therefore, forced convection using active safety systems (gas blowers, heat exchangers, . . .) are highly recommended. Nevertheless, in case of station black-out, the safety demonstration of the concept should be guaranteed by natural circulation heat removal. This could be performed by keeping a relatively high back-up pressure for pure helium convection and also by heavy gas injection. So, it is also necessary to model mixing of different gases, the on-set of natural convection and the pressure and thermal loads onto the proximate or guard containment. In this paper, we report on the developments of the CAST3M/ARCTURUS thermal–hydraulics (Lumped Parameter and CFD) code developed at CEA, including its coupling to the neutronics code CRONOS2 and the system code CATHARE. Elementary validation cases are detailed, as well as application of the code to benchmark problems such as the HTR-10 thermal–hydraulic exercise. Examples of containment thermal–hydraulics calculations for fast reactor design (GFR) are also detailed. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is important to understand the thermal-hydraulic characteristics of HTGR core for optimum design and safe operation. Therefore, this study investigates the thermal-hydraulic behaviors in a segment of pebbles predicted by the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) model using porous and realistic approaches for the complicated geometry. The advantages of each approach’s methodology for the closely packed pebble geometry can be revealed by comparing the calculated results. In an engineering application, a CFD simulation with the porous approach for the pebble geometry can quickly and reasonably capture the averaged behaviors of the thermal-hydraulic parameters as the gas ﬂows through the core, including the pressure drop and temperature increase. However, it is necessary to utilize the realistic approach for this complicated geometry to obtain the detailed and localized characteristics within the ﬂuid and solid fuel regions. The present simulation results can provide useful information to help CFD researchers to determine an appropriate approach to be used when investigating the thermal-hydraulic characteristics within the reactor core of a closely packed pebble bed.},

The CORONA code is targeted for whole-core thermo-fluid analysis of a prismatic gas cooled reactor, with fast computation and reasonable accuracy. In order to achieve this target, the development of CORONA focused on (1) an efficient numerical method, (2) efficient grid generation, and (3) parallel computation. The key idea for the efficient numerical method of CORONA is to solve a three-dimensional solid heat conduction equation combined with one-dimensional fluid flow network equations. The typical difficulties in generating computational grids for a whole core analysis were overcome by using a basic unit cell concept. A fast calculation was finally achieved by a block-wise parallel computation method. The objective of the present paper is to summarize the motivation and strategy, numerical approaches, verification and validation, parallel computation, and perspective of the CORONA code.},

	abstract = {Presented are the results of thermal–hydraulics analyses for a Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) 1/6 core and hexagonal fuel element, with and without helium-coolant bypass ﬂow in interstitial gaps and in the control rod channels. Owing to the complexity and massive size of the VHTR, a full core analysis requires extensive and parallelized computation capabilities and a long time (weeks to months) to complete. These demanding requirements are mostly due to the 3-D computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the helium ﬂow in the 10-m long coolant channels in the reactor core. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of coupling a 1-D helium ﬂow in the channels together with a recently developed and validated convective heat transfer correlation, to a 3-D heat conduction in the graphite and fuel compacts in the core fuel elements. This simpliﬁed thermal–hydraulics analysis methodology for VHTR markedly reduces computation time and memory requirements, while maintaining accurate results. The helium bypass ﬂow in interstitial gaps between fuel elements in the VHTR core provides additional cooling of the edge regions, but increases the temperature near the center of the prismatic fuel elements. Results also show that helium ‘‘bleed’’ ﬂow through the control rod channels minimally affects the temperature distribution within the fuel elements. The heat generation in the corner burnable poison rods in the VHTR core fuel elements affects the temperature only in the close vicinity of the rods.},

A density driven ROCOM experiment as well as an UPTF Tram-C3 experiment have been used for the qualiﬁcation of the Trio U code. Both experiments present similar thermal hydraulic conditions as the reactor case. The predicted boron concentration at the core inlet of the reactor shows that the potential return to criticality might not be excluded in the case of a small break LOCA. Further neutronic calculations are necessary to conﬁrm this result.},

A CFD analysis will help determine if the scaled model is a suitable geometry for validation data. The present article describes the development of an analysis plan for the CFD model. The plan examines the boundary conditions that should be used, the extent of the computational domain that should be included and which turbulence models need not be examined against the data. Calculations are made for a closely related 2D geometry to address these issues. It was found that a CFD model that includes only the inside of the scaled model in its computational domain is adequate for CFD calculations. The realizable k{\textasciitilde}İ model was found not to be suitable for this problem because it did not predict vortex-shedding.},

	abstract = {The very high temperature reactor (VHTR) system behavior should be predicted during normal operating conditions and postulated accident conditions. The plant accident scenario and the passive safety behavior should be accurately predicted. Uncertainties in passive safety behavior could have large effects on the resulting system characteristics. Due to these performance issues in the VHTR, there is a need for development, testing and validation of design tools to demonstrate the feasibility of the design concepts and guide the improvement of the plant components. One of the identiﬁed design issues for the gas-cooled reactor is the thermal mixing of the coolant exiting the core into the outlet plenum. Incomplete thermal mixing may give rise to thermal stresses in the downstream components. To provide ﬂow details, the analysis presented in this paper was performed by coupling a VHTR model generated in a thermal hydraulic systems code to a computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) outlet plenum model. The outlet conditions obtained from the systems code VHTR model provide the inlet boundary conditions to the CFD outlet plenum model. By coupling the two codes in this manner, the important three-dimensional ﬂow effects in the outlet plenum are well modeled while avoiding modeling the entire reactor with a computationally expensive CFD code. The values of pressure, mass ﬂow rate and temperature across the coupled boundary showed differences of less than 5\% in every location except for one channel. The coupling auxiliary program used in this analysis can be applied to many different cases requiring detailed three-dimensional modeling in a small portion of the domain.},

	abstract = {A Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is designed to generate high temperature which is typically around 950 °C at the outlet. The high temperature results in thermal stress with dimensional changes in addition to the mechanical stress caused by the external loads. It is necessary to assess the structural integrity of the graphite blocks and fuel compacts for thermal stress and dimensional changes; however, precise assessment has not been conducted because of the complexity of the fuel assembly geometry and absence of accurate temperature distribution. In the present study, a ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) of each fuel element in a 10-story fuel assembly was carried out by using the temperature distribution which was calculated from a previous study of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) analysis on the fuel assembly. The results showed that the maximum stress level in the fuel elements reaches 32\% of the tensile strength. The maximum stress point was at the circumference of the bottom surface of a graphite plug on which the thermal expansion of the fuel compacts pushes up the graphite plug. Mitigation of the maximum stress by placing a small gap between the graphite plug and the fuel compact was investigated and the effect of the gap was conﬁrmed. Stress evaluation was performed according to a draft of standard for nuclear graphite. All stress components lied within the limits and the structural integrity was regarded to be attained.},

Other aspects related to C++ programming paradigms, reusability for diverse applications, adaptive modeling, physics-independent error indicators, and similar concepts are brieﬂy discussed.

	abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations and integro-diﬀerential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear ﬁxed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with signiﬁcant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information.},

Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-speciﬁc applications, all built on the same software framework, are efﬁciently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a ﬂexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simpliﬁed Westinghouse AP-1000 conﬁguration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling—in a coupled, multiscale manner—crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shufﬂe.},

This text introduces the student to the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission chain reactions in a manner that renders the transition to practical nuclear reactor design methods most natural. The authors stress throughout the very close interplay between the nuclear analysis of a reactor core and those nonnuclear aspects of core analysis, such as thermal-hydraulics or materials studies, which play a major role in determining a reactor design.},

Despite large empirical literatures and suggestive case evidence, there are, however, few methodologically strong studies that establish causal effects on an economy-wide basis. There is some evidence that reliability of electricity supply is important for economic growth. We propose that future research focuses on identifying the causal effects of electricity reliability, infrastructure, and access on economic growth; testing the replicability of the literature; and deepening our theoretical understanding of how lack of availability of electricity can be a constraint to growth.},

The INL HTE program has included small-scale experiments, detailed computational modeling, system modeling, and technology demonstration. Aspects of all of these activities are included in this report. In terms of technology demonstration, the INL successfully completed a 1000-hour test of the HTE Integrated Laboratory Scale (ILS) technology demonstration experiment during the fall of 2008. The HTE ILS achieved a hydrogen production rate in excess of 5.7 Nm3/hr, with a power consumption of 18 kW. This hydrogen production rate is far larger than has been demonstrated by any of the thermochemical or hybrid processes to date.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy became the most significant energy as the current demand gradually starts to increase. Hydrogen energy is an important key solution to tackle the global temperature rise. The key important factor of hydrogen production is the hydrogen economy. Hydrogen production technologies are commercially available, while some of these technologies are still under development. This paper reviews the hydrogen production technologies from both fossil and non-fossil fuels such as (steam reforming, partial oxidation, auto thermal, pyrolysis, and plasma technology). Additionally, water electrolysis technology was reviewed. Water electrolysis can be combined with the renewable energy to get eco-friendly technology. Currently, the maximum hydrogen fuel productions were registered from the steam reforming, gasification, and partial oxidation technologies using fossil fuels. These technologies have different challenges such as the total energy consumption and carbon emissions to the environment are still too high. A novel non-fossil fuel method [ammonia NH3] for hydrogen production using plasma technology was reviewed. Ammonia decomposition using plasma technology without and with a catalyst to produce pure hydrogen was considered as compared case studies. It was showed that the efficiency of ammonia decomposition using the catalyst was higher than ammonia decomposition without the catalyst. The maximum hydrogen energy efficiency obtained from the developed ammonia decomposition system was 28.3\% with a hydrogen purity of 99.99\%. The development of ammonia decomposition processes is continues for hydrogen production, and it will likely become commercial and be used as a pure hydrogen energy source.},

Energy efﬁciency is important in providing hydrogen economically and in a climate friendly manner. High operating temperatures are needed for more efﬁcient thermochemical and electrochemical hydrogen production using nuclear energy. Therefore, high-temperature reactors, such as the gas-cooled, molten-salt-cooled and liquid-metal-cooled reactor technologies, are the candidates for use in hydrogen production. Several candidate technologies that span the range from well developed to conceptual are compared in our analysis. Among these alternatives, high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) coupled to an advanced gas reactor cooled by supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) and equipped with a supercritical CO2 power conversion cycle has the potential to provide higher energy efﬁciency at a lower temperature range than the other alternatives.},

These systems are often referred to as nuclear hy- brid energy systems (NHES) and are generally robust, reliable, economically appealing, and have low to zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [1, 2, 3, 4]. In 2015, the University of Illi- nois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) made a commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 in the Illinois Climate Ac- tion Plan (iCAP) [5]. This plan identified nuclear energy as a potential contributor to this goal. In this work we use the RAVEN framework to find the optimal size for a micro-reactor that would minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the UIUC embedded grid. The greatest source economic variability is contained in the capital costs of a micro-reactor. Thus we examine both scenarios where the reactor is provided at no cost to the university and purchased at full price.},

	abstract = {The demand for more practical and innovative nuclear reactor designs capable of providing clean energy to meet new global demands is revolutionizing the nuclear industry. In this paper we present the fuel cycle and neutronics analysis of a design expected to be similar to the Westinghouse eVinci™ heat pipe (HP) reactor. The concept considered here uses low enriched urania rods and potassium liquid metal-cooled HPs to remove heat from the core. The fuel and HPs are contained in steel monolith to form the core which is surrounded by an alumina reflector. There is no need for forced circulation to remove heat from the active core region, thus eliminating the use of pumps, valves and tube piping. The concept is designed to operate safely and provide a reliable autonomous power supply in support of off-grid missions. This study shows that the HP reactor design can operate for more than 10 years without refueling. Further, we show that the current design of the HP reactor concept is best suited to serve as a nuclear battery rather than a centralized power source. We also studied the nuclear fuel cycle performance of the HP reactor concept in a once-through fuel cycle. The natural resource utilization, waste output, and environmental impact, as defined in a reference study from the literature, did not perform as well on a GWe per year energy basis compared to light water reactors with less than 5\% enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. Parasitic absorption in the steel monolith structure and neutron leakage lower the reactivity of the core, which decreases the discharge burnup of the fuel. Analysis of modifications of the monolith material and size of the reference core configuration showed that the neutron leakage impact on the small sized HP core is the most limiting factor on the fuel cycle performance.},

System analysis results have been obtained using the commercial code UniSim, augmented with a custom high-temperature electrolyzer module. The process flow diagrams for the system simulations include an advanced nuclear reactor as a source of high-temperature process heat, a power cycle and a coupled steam electrolysis loop. Several reactor types and power cycles have been considered, over a range of reactor coolant outlet temperatures.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews water electrolysis technologies for hydrogen production and also surveys the state of the art of water electrolysis integration with renewable energies. First, attention is paid to the thermodynamic and electrochemical processes to better understand how electrolysis cells work and how they can be combined to build big electrolysis modules. The electrolysis process and the characteristics, advantages, drawbacks, and challenges of the three main existing electrolysis technologies, namely alkaline, polymer electrolyte membrane, and solid oxide electrolyte, are then discussed. Current manufacturers and the main features of commercially available electrolyzers are extensively reviewed. Finally, the possible configurations allowing the integration of water electrolysis units with renewable energy sources in both autonomous and grid-connected systems are presented and some relevant demonstration projects are commented.},
