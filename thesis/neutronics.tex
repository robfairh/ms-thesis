\section{Preliminary studies}

This section will discuss the current capabilities in Moltres and discuss its applicability to PMRs.

\section{OECD/NEA Benchmark}

This section solves the Exercise 1 of Phase I of the OECD/NEA MHTGR-350 benchmark with the current Moltres capabilities.

\section{Serpent-Moltres validation}

This section compares the results from Moltres and Serpent.
Serpent generates the homogenized group constants and also solves the heterogeneous system, which provides the reference solutions for the validation of the calculation scheme.
