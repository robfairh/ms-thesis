\begin{itemize}
	\item Steam-Methane Reforming:
\end{itemize}

Steam reforming is a catalytic process where a reaction between natural gas (or other light hydrocarbons) and steam takes place.
The result of a series of reactions is a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water.
The first reforming step catalytically reacts methane with steam to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide in an endothermic reaction.
A second reaction, exothermic, shifts the carbon monoxide with steam to form additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
Finally, an adsorption process could remove the carbon dioxide \cite{harper_us_2012}.
This process is currently the least expensive way to produce hydrogen \cite{doe_office_of_energy_efficiency_and_renewable_energy_hydrogen_2020}.

A \gls{HTGR} can substitute the natural gas burning furnaces as a heat source.
This approach reduces the \gls{CO2} emissions to the atmosphere in large quantities.
Nevertheless, due to the nature of the chemical reforming and shifting processes, this method still needs a natural gas feedstock \cite{yildiz_efficiency_2006}.
Consequently, the method still emits \gls{CO2}, unless it includes a sequestration method.
A sequestration process complicates the plant layout and makes the process more expensive.
For this reason, we will not include this method in the analysis.
Further studies could consider it.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Coal Gasification:
\end{itemize}

The gasification of coal is one method that can produce power, liquid fuels, chemicals, and hydrogen.
Specifically, reacting coal with oxygen and steam under high pressures and temperatures forms a synthesis gas, a mixture consisting primarily of carbon monoxide and hydrogen \cite{doe_office_of_energy_efficiency_and_renewable_energy_hydrogen_2020}.
After removing the impurities from the synthesis gas, the water-gas shift reaction produces additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide form the carbon monoxide in the gas mixture.
A separation system removes the hydrogen.
This method still emits \gls{CO2} requiring a carbon sequestration system.
We will not consider this process in the analysis.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Electrolysis:
\end{itemize}

The electrolysis of water is a well-known method whose commercial use began in 1890.
This process produces approximately a 4\% of \gls{H2} worldwide.
The process is ecologically clean because it does not emit \glspl{GHG}, and the oxygen
produced has further industrial applications.
However, in comparison with other methods, electrolysis is a highly energy-demanding technology
\cite{kalamaras_hydrogen_2013}.

Three electrolysis technologies exist.
Alkaline-based is the most common, the most developed, and the lowest in capital cost.
It has the lowest efficiency and, therefore, the highest electrical energy cost.
Proton exchange membrane electrolyzers are more efficient but more expensive than Alkaline electrolyzers.
\gls{SOEC} electrolyzers are the most electrically efficient but the least developed.
\gls{SOEC} technology has challenges with corrosion, seals, thermal cycling, and chrome migration \cite{kalamaras_hydrogen_2013}.
As the first two technologies work with liquid water and the latter requires high temperature steam, we will refer to the first two as \gls{LTE} and the latter as \gls{HTE}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Thermo-chemical Water Splitting:
\end{itemize}

Thermochemical water-splitting is the conversion of water into hydrogen and oxygen by a series of thermally driven chemical reactions.
The direct thermolysis of water requires temperatures in excess of 2500 $^{\circ}$C for significant hydrogen generation.
At this temperature, the process is able to decompose a 10\% of the water.
A thermochemical water-splitting cycle accomplishes the same overall result using much lower temperatures.

In \cite{brown_high_2003}, General Atomics, Sandia National Laboratories, and the University of Kentucky compared 115 cycles that would use high temperature heat from an advanced nuclear reactor.
The reports specifies a set of objective screening criteria used to rate each cycle.
The highest scoring method was the \gls{SI} Cycle.

In 1978 and 1980, the process was coupled to a nuclear reactor.
The latter flowsheet indicated that hydrogen could be produced at 52\% efficiency.
This is the highest efficiency reported for any water-splitting process, based on an integrated flowsheet \cite{brown_high_2003}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Photobiological processes:
\end{itemize}

In photolytic biological systems, microorganisms—such as green microalgae or cyanobacteria—use sunlight to split water into oxygen and hydrogen.
Challenges for this pathway include low rates of hydrogen production, low solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, and the fact that splitting water also produces oxygen \cite{doe_office_of_energy_efficiency_and_renewable_energy_hydrogen_2020}.
The latter inhibits the hydrogen production reaction and can be a safety issue.
All these challenges make it a commercially unviable pathway at this time.
We will not consider this method for the analysis.

\section{Microreactors and \glspl{SMR}}
\label{sec:reactors}

These reactor concepts share several features.
The reactors require limited on-site prepariton as their compones are factory fabricated.
This feature reduces up-front capital costs and expedites start-up times.


% Microreactor features
Three main features define a microreactor: it is factory fabricated, transportable, and self-regulating.
All of the components are fully assembled in a factory and shipped out to the generation site, reducing capital costs and enabling rapid deployment.

Small designs make it easy for vendors to ship the entire reactor by truck, shipping vessel, or railcar.
Simplified design concepts enhance self-regulating capabilities and eliminate the need for many specialized operators and maintenance staff.
Moreover, they utilize passive safety systems that prevent overheating or meltdown.
These main features make the technology appealing for a wide range of applications, such as deployment in remote residential locations and military bases \cite{us-doe_ultimate_2019}.

% SMR features
\glspl{SMR} require limited on-site preparation as their components are factory fabricated, reducing up-front capital costs and expediting start-up times.
This reactor concept allows for black starts and islanding operation mode.
They can start up from a completely de-energized state without receiving power from the grid.
They can also operate connected to the grid or independently.
Moreover, they minimize electrical parts and use passive cooling features to safely shutdown.
Other benefits include underground construction, which makes reactors less vulnerable to extreme weather and physical attacks \cite{us-doe_ultimate_2019}.

The \gls{DOE} defines a microreactor as a reactor that generates from 1 to 20 MW$_{th}$ \cite{us-doe_ultimate_2019}.
The \gls{IAEA} describes a \gls{SMR} as a reactor whose power is under 300 MWe.
However, it adds another definition.
It defines a very small modular reactor as a reactor that produces less than 15 MWe \cite{world_nuclear_association_small_2020}.
As the definitions of these reactor concepts overlap, we will consider reactors of less than 100 MW$_{th}$ regardless of their classification.
