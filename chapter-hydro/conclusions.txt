The world faces energy challenges that compromise the efforts to stop climate change.
The electricity generation and transportation sectors are the largest issuers of \glspl{GHG} and, hence, the major contributors to climate change.
These challenges underscores the need for cleaner sources.
Nonetheless, the common belief that renewable energy is the solution to the problem presents several drawbacks.
The duck curve is an example of such drawbacks.
Moreover, a carbon neutral electric grid will be insufficient to halt climate change.
The transportation sector needs to survey some possible alternatives to become carbon free as well.
In this work, we proposed a combination between nuclear energy and hydrogen production that represents a possible solution to these challenges.

To seek a solution for the challenge described above, we narrowed down out focus on a more particular case, the University of Illinois.
Through the implementation of the \gls{icap}, the University of Illinois is actively working to reduce \gls{GHG} emissions on its campus.
The objective of this work aligns with the efforts in two of the six target areas defined on the \gls{icap}, electricity generation and transportation.

Regarding the hydrogen production methods, we surveyed three different processes: \gls{LTE}, \gls{HTE}, and \gls{SI}.
We developed a tool to calculate their energy requirements, in terms of electricity and heat, and hydrogen production rates.
This tool is not only applicable to a stand-alone hydrogen plant but also to a nuclear power plant that produces both electricity and hydrogen.

On the transportation sector, we quantified the fuel requirements of \gls{MTD} and \gls{UIUC} fleets.
With that fuel requirement we calculated the mass of hydrogen necessary to replace the fossil fuel usage by both fleets in a 100$\%$.
Finally, we chose several microreactor designs and we calculated their hydrogen production rates.
The microreactors that are able to meet both fleet hydrogen needs are the MMR, ST-OTTO, U-battery, and Starcore.
Starcore design is the only one that could use the \gls{SI} process.

On the electricity generation sector, we predicted the magnitude of the duck curve in UIUC's grid in 2050.
This result exhibits how an increased solar penetration into the grid worsens the duck curve.
We proposed a mitigation strategy that uses a microreactor of 25 MWe.
With such reactor, we calculated the mass of hydrogen produced by the different methods during the day.
Finally, we estimated a peak demand reduction by using the hydrogen produced during the day.
This last result highlight the fact that hydrogen introduces a means to store energy that reduces the reliance on dispatchable sources.
This analysis emphasize how nuclear energy and hydrogen production are an approach to mitigate climate change.
