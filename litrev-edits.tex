Why the temperature has to be averaged:
% stainsby_investigation_2008
Each fuel compact contains thousand of TRISO coated particles, and ultimately we require the average and maximum temperatures of the fuel kernels and surrounding coatings, both for use in neutronics calculations and to be able to estimate fuel failure fractions and fission product release rates.
