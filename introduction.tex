\section{MMR}

The Micro Modular Reactor (MMR) concept integrates power production, power conversion, and electricity generation in a single unit, making it suitable for use in remote areas. 
The MMR will use fully ceramic micro-encapsulated (FCM) fuel, which is a form of TRISO fuel, and He (or CO$_2$) as coolant.
The power of this reactor will range between 10 to 40 MW-thermal and its cycle length will be greater than 20 years.
The MMR design results attractive for replacing diesel generators in remote areas. As it could be factory produced, it could generate power at economically competitive prices \cite{hawari_development_2018}.
