Moltres can solve the equations in a fully-coupled way or solve each system independently allowing for great flexibility and making it applicable to a wide range of nuclear engineering problems.
% All codes use MPI for parallel communication and allow for deployement on massively-parallel cluster-computing platforms.
% MOOSE applications by default use monolithic and implicit methods ideal for closely-coupled and multi-scale physics.

In addition to the development of new methods, it is essential to define appropriate benchmarks to compare the capabilities of various computer codes.
The \gls{OECD} \gls{NEA} defined such benchmark for the \gls{MHTGR}-350 MW reactor \cite{oecd_nea_benchmark_2017}.
The scope of the benchmark is twofold: 1) to establish a well-defined problem, based on a common given data set, to compare methods and tools in core simulation and thermal fluids analysis, 2) to test the depletion capabilities of various lattice physics codes available for \glspl{PMR}.
The objective of this work is to conduct Exercise 1 of Phase I of the benchmark with Moltres.
Finally, we will compare the results to the already published results from the benchmark.

SPH treatment?
Diffusion codes may work if the cross sections are properly prepared using a lattice code that captures all layers of heterogeneity including spectral penetration between blocks. Monte Carlo codes are suitable for steady state design and high fidelity reference solutions (SERPENT, MCNP-ORIGEN, MONTEBURN)
