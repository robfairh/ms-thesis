This work's ultimate goal is to support the development of \gls{HTGR} technology.
More specifically, we focus on the development of computational methods for modeling \glspl{HTGR}.
We use \textit{Moltres} as our main tool.

% Why do we focus on HTGRs?
The Generation IV Roadmap project identified reactor concepts that could meet the energy demands of the future in an efficient, economic, and environmentally safe manner \cite{macdonald_ngnp_2003}.
One of these reactor concepts is the \gls{VHTR}.
\gls{VHTR} is distinct from \gls{HTGR} as its coolant outlet temperature reaches higher temperatures.
However, the literature often uses these terms interchangeably.
In this work, the term \gls{HTGR} encompasses both terms.
The \gls{DOE} had selected this reactor concept for the, now canceled, \gls{NGNP} Project.
This project intended to demonstrate emissions-free nuclear-assisted electricity and hydrogen production by 2015.

Although the \gls{DOE} has canceled the \gls{NGNP} Project, \glspl{HTGR} will become a reality in the near future.
Some microreactor designs embody this type technology and may be operational before 2030.
Additionally, as the introduction has already described, the \gls{HTGR} technology has several favorable characteristics.
To recapitulate the most important features, the \gls{HTGR} relies on passive heat transfer mechanisms, uses TRISO particles as its fuel, has a high proliferation resistance, has the ability to achieve high temperatures, and benefits from increased cycle efficiencies.
Other beneficial characteristics are that high temperatures enable a wide range of process heat applications, among which we find hydrogen production.

%Why is computational modeling important?
Modeling and prediction of core thermal-hydraulic behavior is necessary for assessing the safety characteristics of a reactor.
Determining the temperature inside a reactor, for both normal and transient operation, is of paramount importance as the integrity of several materials depends on it.
Most importantly, undesirably high temperatures endanger the integrity of the TRISO particles and, consequently, jeopardize a fission product release \cite{tak_numerical_2008}.
% The temperatures in the core have to be kept below values that begin to cause damage to fission product barriers, produce stmctural material weakness, and lead to excessive chemical reaction rates.
Furthermore, the complex geometry of the fuel blocks hinders accurate evaluations of the fuel temperatures requiring elaborate numerical calculations.

The characteristics of a \gls{HTGR} are different from those of conventional \glspl{LWR}.
Such differences create a demand for new reactor analysis tools.
This new tools should take into account the following peculiarities of \glspl{HTGR} \cite{rohde_development_2012}\cite{bostelmann_criticality_2016}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hexagonal structure: the shape of the fuel blocks does not conform to any orthogonal coordinate system.
\item Double heterogeneity: the TRISO particles form the first level of heterogeneity, as they consist of four layers. The second level arises from the fuel elements, as they encompass the compacts, the coolant, and the moderator.
\item Strong dependence of the neutron spectrum and the macroscopic cross sections on the fuel temperatures.
\item Long transients caused by high thermal inertia of the reactor core due to the presence of large graphite structures.
\end{itemize}

%Why use Moltres?
Historically, linking a stand-alone neutronics solver to a thermal-hydraulics solver allowed for the simulation of an entire reactor.
The coupling of the codes occurred in a black-box fashion, where the output of one code served as the input of the other, and vice versa.
This coupling technique is commonly known as the operator-splitting technique.
In such approach, each individual physics isolates the action of the governing equations upon the variables.
Nonetheless, these physical models, in reality, describe processes that rely heavily on the
solution of one another’s.
\glspl{HTGR} have a strong temperature feedback, causing an increased coupling between the neutronics and the thermal-hydraulics phenomena.
%Neutronics/thermal-fluid coupled analysis is also required due to the strong interaction between the temperature and the power in a VHTR core.
Because of a large time-scale separation between the different phenomena, multiphysics transient simulations coupled via the operator-splitting approach may introduce significant numerical errors  \cite{ragusa_consistent_2009} \cite{park_tightly_2010}.

\gls{MOOSE} \cite{gaston_moose_2009} is a computational framework targeted at solving fully coupled systems.
All the software built on the \gls{MOOSE} framework shares a common code base.
This feature facilitates relatively easy coupling between different phenomena and allows for great flexibility even with large variance in time scales \cite{novak_pronghorn_2018}.
These characteristics make the framework suitable for solving the type of physical phenomena describe above.
\textit{Moltres} \cite{lindsay_introduction_2018} is a \gls{FEM} simulation code built on the \gls{MOOSE} framework.
