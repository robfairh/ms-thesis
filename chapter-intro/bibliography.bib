The governing equations and material models applicable to particle fuel and implemented in BISON are outlined. Code veriﬁcation based on a recent IAEA benchmarking exercise is described, and excellent comparisons are reported. Multiple TRISO-coated particles of increasing geometric complexity are considered. The code’s ability to use the same algorithms and models to solve problems of varying dimensionality from 1D through 3D is demonstrated. The code provides rapid solutions of 1D spherically symmetric and 2D axially symmetric models, and its scalable parallel processing capability allows for solutions of large, complex 3D models. Additionally, the ﬂexibility to easily include new physical and material models and straightforward ability to couple to lower length scale simulations makes BISON a powerful tool for simulation of coated-particle fuel. Future code development activities and potential applications are identiﬁed.},

	abstract = {This century power engineering is facing up to one of the greatest challenges ever posed to humankind: the achievement of a sustainable energy system. In order to respond to this challenge, Nuclear Technology is designing a new generation of power plants termed Generation IV, among them High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors stand out for their potential capability to achieve an excellent thermal performance. This paper investigates the thermal and economic performance of several direct Brayton cycle configurations that could be used in future HTGRs, with special attention to the effects of intercooling and reheating. Among the hypotheses and assumptions taken, the adoption of the PBMR reactor parameters and settings as a reference is particularly important. All inter-cooled layouts have shown thermal efficiencies near or even higher than 50\%, which means a substantial improvement with respect to non-intercooled baselines with no economic penalties. Reheating has been shown not to affect remarkably the thermal or economic plant performance under base-load operation, but it provides the plant with such a flexibility that allows its operation under the “load-follow” regime without heavily taxing the thermal or economic performance. Anyway, use of a multiple axes configuration instead of a single one seems to worsen plant economics and not to entail any thermal benefit.},

Criticality measurements performed at several temperature points at this Japanese graphitemoderated facility were recently included in the International Handbook of Evaluated Reactor Physics Benchmark Experiments, and represent one of the few data sets available for the validation of HTGR lattice physics. This work compares VHTRC criticality simulations utilizing the Monte Carlo codes Serpent and SCALE/KENO-VI. Reasonable agreement was found between Serpent and KENO-VI, but only the use of the latest ENDF cross section library release, namely the ENDF/B-VII.1 library, led to an improved match with the measured data. Furthermore, the fourth beta release of SCALE 6.2/KENO-VI showed significant improvements from the current SCALE 6.1.2 version, compared to the experimental values and Serpent.},
