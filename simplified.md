the unit cell:

The unit cell model
only notices that the regular region in the interior of the fuel blocks
consists of triangular-shaped unit cells (see Fig. 4). It assumes that
the unit cell is a symmetry section such that the heat generated
in the fuel of the triangular region is only removed by the coolant
in the hole of the triangle.
