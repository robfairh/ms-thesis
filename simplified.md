The flow network model:

shenoy_htgr_1974 p.54
The flow network model treats the coolant flow paths in the core as a cross-connected flow network to calculate the core flow distribution.
Constant pressure nodes connected to flow branches make up a flow network.
The model uses the one-dimensional conservation momentum equations to solve the pressure loss and coolant temperature in each network node.





The equivalent cylinder model:
The equivalent cylinder model uses a geometrically simpler one-dimensional or two-dimensional design model.



The unit cell:

tak_numerical_2008
The unit cell model only notices that the regular region in the interior of the fuel blocks consists of triangular-shaped unit cells.
It assumes that the unit cell is a symmetry section such that the heat generated in the fuel of the triangular region is only removed by the coolant in the hole of the triangle.
